Florentino,['warrior'],"['Blossom', 'Triple Threat', ""Gentlemen's Duel""]","Flowers, women - I desire all that is beautiful.As the sole heir to the House of Perfume, Florentino's romantic adventures were as well-known as his lavish balls.The people of Casanova spoke of extravagant scenes of great halls and illustrious guests and their retinues of servants numbering in the hundreds if not thousands, endless lines of carts bringing fine food to the estate along paths paved with fresh flowers, and eager noble ladies in their best dresses and jewels.Even the common folk benefited from the affair. The flowers that decorated the road were given out after the party started, filling peasant homes with fresh fragrance for days, while leftover food was given to the poor and needy, a rare opportunity for them to put meat on the table.Considering the illustrious martial history of the House of Perfume, Florentino's lavish lifestyle was generally frowned upon. My stable boy could beat Lord Florentino with one hand tied behind his back was a running joke among high society. And while Florentino garnered praise from those who benefited from his generosity (or indifference), to many of the common folk he was but a spoiled brat blessed with more gold than he knows what to do with.Florentino himself was thoroughly unconcerned about such views. From a very young age he knew he was different from other people. His blood has given him wealth, title and talent, giving him the freedom to live as he pleased, and he chose the easiest way of life by far.The House of Perfume's wealth and prestige was built upon the genius and hard work of eleven generations. What better way to honor their wisdom than to show the world the result of this hard work?As war raged on the frontlines, Florentino continued to sit comfortably in the rear, enjoying all that life has to offer. Yet the Duke of Rose did nothing to curb his lavish lifestyle. Florentino had broken no law or decree. Far from it, his lavish spending drove trade and taxation in the land, providing the common folk with opportunity for work and luring many to move to Casanova.This has allowed the Knights of Rose to enjoy a steady supply line, not just in arms and food, but in soldiers as well.And so the Duke of Rose turned an eye from Florentino's lifestyle - until it came a time when Florentino built a grand and majestic ship, inviting honored guests to join him to sail upstream into the mysterious Elborne Woods and see the beauty of the elves with their own eyes. The ambitious plan drew the attention of the realm, and every noble considered it an honor to receive an invitation to board the ship.Even Astrid, the Duke of Rose's only granddaughter, joined the trip with her retinue of knights. She thought little of the famously spoiled young noble, but the war depended on Casanova's stability, and Casanova's stability depended on Florentino coming back from this trip in one piece.Do as I tell you, and I will make sure your head stays on your shoulders. Those were the only words Astrid said to Florentino before she turned and walked away. Florentino just smiled and shrugged - he is always kind and patient with the ladies, especially the beautiful ones.The ship returned after just one month, hardly enough to even reach the edge of the Elborne Woods. Curious questions followed, of course, but they received only one response from the noble guests on the trip - determined, absolute silence. All people knew was that Astrid returned calmer, steadier, looking more mature than she ever had been - and she asked to study with Florentino, in the most solemn and dignified ceremony possible. The Madness of Astrid soon become the talk of the kingdom.No explanation was forthcoming until several years later, when the Okka Kingdom in the north entered into alliance with the Normans in the south. It turmed out that Florentino's ship had barely entered Okka territory, when they were attacked by Okka Knights corrupted by the Abyss. When Astrid was injured by an assassin in the chaos, it was Florentino who drew his sword and stepped forward, defeating the assassin and the attacking knights with moves beyond the comprehension of normal men, saving Astrid's life.The guests on the ship looked on in shock at this side of Florentino that they have never seen or even imagined. To avoid any possible political implications, all those involved were bound to an oath of absolute silence. Even so, Astrid's determination to study with him was the source of much commotion, something that Florentino would much rather have done without. But there was no denying the request of a lady so beautiful in appearance, yet so fiery and determined in soul.Well, I never could turn down a beautiful girl!",Florentino_image.jpg
Riktor,['warrior'],"['Jungle Strike', 'Retaliate', 'Mark of the Hunter']","“Hey, dude, have you seen a demon before? I mean, an actual demon, the one that can think and speak.”“Of course I have.”“Really? What does it look like?”“Well, I didn’t see it clearly. I was in a battle with it. It bashed my head with a hammer so hard that I fainted. When I woke up, the battle had ended already.”“Haha, no wonder they call you Riktor the Boaster! You look hilarious when you act serious.”“Boaster? Hey, I wasn’t boasting!” Riktor muttered, taking a consoling sip of the bitterly sour malt from his hip flask.He was telling the truth.As a former Demon Hunter, Riktor used to battle with real demons alongside his comrades. This group of super warriors was modified with Abyssal Essence, which significantly enhanced their individual strength and stamina to a whole new level. Thus, the warriors were enabled to directly confront the demons.It was the glorious era of demon hunting. In regions where mobs of dark creatures wrecked havoc on, the Demon Hunters were highly respected by the people, even more so than any legion. However, with the occurrence of the Descendants and the emergence of “War of Purification”, the Demon Hunters, who were closely related to the Descendants, were in jeopardy.Even though they passed a series of magic examinations, their damaged reputation was beyond saving. In the end, all Demon Hunters were enlisted in the army and deployed at the front line in the South. They pledged allegiance to the right side by sacrificing themselves in the war with the abyssal force. Riktor is one of the few surviving Demon Hunters.Upon the review and evaluation by the Magic Committee, Riktor was allowed to return to the human community after the war. With him were the salaries he had been saving and several hundreds of the military badges of his passed fellows. He knew that what his comrades sacrificed and achieved would remain in this world as long as he stayed alive.“The past is even more addictive than alcohol!” Riktor awoke from his nostalgic dreams to find out his hip flask was running dry. Gently he tugged it in his pocket, for he had to ration the remainder before he reached the supply depot. Otherwise, the lonely, long nights would be unbearable. At that moment, he prayed that the loathsome creatures lurking in the dark would reveal themselves at once, so that he could finish his duty of “demon hunting” as soon as possible.Nowadays, Riktor works as a freelance mercenary. Seven days ago, he joined a caravan that had been stalked by the dark creatures for days by disguising as a lost member of his own group. What truly attracted the evil creatures was a wealth of Magic Ores from the great desert in the west inside the truck driven by eight mounts.At first, the mercenaries of the caravan did not get along with the clumsy Riktor. After Riktor handed out a small packet of silver, they gladly welcomed him. For them, silver is almost as precious as gold. That is why when Riktor volunteered to take the watch at night, the chief declined his request and asked him to go to bed, reassuring him, “On this trade route, no one dares to mess with us.”“It’s not humans that I’m concerned!” Riktor murmured, taking out a silver again. He whispered to the chief, “No one wonders where you are at this time of the night. Why don’t you take some rest now to save some energy for the day?”Just like that, Riktor “paid” his way to take on the night shift. Yet, he was still a rookie, so the chief sent Layne to keep him company. Riktor did not care at all. In fact, he completely immersed himself into the dark night.“How much longer can you hide?” Riktor gazed at the bonfire, talking to himself. All out a sudden, a gust of wind blew in, as if answering Riktor’s question. Temperature around the campsite plummeted, and Riktor realized that the prey he had been awaiting was about to show up.The abrupt changes in the environment awoke the mercenaries. They were not as sensitive to the dark creatures as Riktor, but years of experience in battle had granted them an acute sense of danger. When they came out of the camp, fully armed, they witnessed a nightmarish scene: Riktor, swinging his sword, was battling with a swarm of horrific dark creatures.“Although the title of Demon Hunter no longer exists, I never forget my responsibilities as a Demon Hunter!” Riktor took a look at the prey in front him, mumbling, “I know that you’d never forget the danger and horror this title brought to us. No matter what, I’ll not walk away.”He pointed his sword to the sky, as if the Goddess of Light tore the darkness apart with her finger.“I fight where the darkness befalls!”",Riktor_image.jpg
Sephera,['mage'],"['Water Spirits', 'Wall of Water', 'Tide of Life']","Water, the source of all life.Like a blue ribbon, the Losarth River gentry wraps around Carano, giving life to this border city. In the middle of the river stands a great statue of the legendary mage Sephera, founder of the Magister Council, Archmagister of the Academy, and the one who single-handedly created the Miracle of Losarth.Sephera's first taste of magic came from her family's mage retainer.Many nobles kept a mage retainer, whom they sponsored and supported in exchange for the protection of the family and its lands. Not only is the mage responsible for dealing with any issues having to do with the arcane or unnatural: the strength of a family's mage retainer also reflects the power and prestige of the family itself.Children who show a talent for magic are often sent to study with mages, perhaps even taking on their master's mantle once they complete their studies, becoming their family's new guardian. Among these already talented individuals, Sephera stood out.From a very young age she had an innate grasp of the arcane, soon surpassing  her mentor. She was also a devout follower of the Temple, often taking part in the Temple's religious and charitable activities, and would have joined the Temple, were it not for her duty to her own family.The uninitiated may find Sephera's dual roles as an apprentice mage and a devout believer to be in conflict, but as told by the Scunthor, the First Mage, the first magic came from the gods and was taught to humans by the demi-gods in the Primal Era, thus becoming the mortal expression of the immortal divine, which humans have been permitted to wield. And so the Temple welcomed Sephera with open arms. Having suffered greatly during the First Invasion, the Temple was eager to attract believers, especially one as powerful as Sephera. Yet the renaissance of the Temple inevitably came into conflict with the interests of the noble class, as well as the mages who served them. Sephera was caught between the two, mage's staff in one hand, the Temple's teaching in the other.This delicate balance was broken by the War of Purification. Far too many mages had been allowed to conduct inhumane experiments in dark magic for far too long in the name of knowledge. Their exposure by the Temple turned public opinion against dark magic. Already a well-known mage, Sephera joined the war with illustrious allies such as Dirak and Dolsey, leading the vanguard in the crusade against dark magic.As the war raged on, however, more and more factions were caught in the fray. With many of the old nobles mired in the war due to their connection with dark mages, younger houses emerged and tried to take advantage, escalating the war for their own ends. At the frontlines, Sephera felt matters spinning out of control and tried to be a voice of reason, but before she could come up with a plan, she found her comrade Dolsey caught in the middle of the conflict.To help Dolsey and other innocent mages, and to bring the movement back in line with its original aim, Sephera leveraged her family's influence and tried to seek help from the Temple. But too many within the Temple had too much at stake in this war – aligned with the new houses, they had too much to gain from the fall of the old nobles and the mages. They could not stop now.Why does the light I believe in relegate me to the shadows? In the face of the Temple's indifference, Sephera asked herself herself. She began to understand why Dirak and Dolsey were so wary of her faith, despite being of one mind with her on so many other things.But Sephera is a mage. When justice is absent, she turns to magic. With Dirak and her other comrades, Sephera saved the lives of many innocent mages. A movement that began as an opposition to dark magic now found itself in conflict with the new houses as well.Eventually, Sephera and her allies had to flee to the border regions, where the power of the nobles could not touch them. Many mages joined them, either out of a sense of duty or just pure necessity. This was what became the Magister Council, founded at Carano.The Council transformed the backwater town of Carano, building great towers that scrape the sky, calling to all the mages who previously had to fight their own battles to join forces and defend their way of life. And for hundreds of years since, its founder and leader Sephera has defended this new city, just as the river she created does.Those blessed with great power are obliged to protect those without it.",Sephera_image.jpg
Quillen,['assassin'],"['Mutilate', 'Decimate', 'Assassinate']","“The survival and dignity of mankind is solely reliant on swords and guns.”Quillen is the rising political star in the Free Federation. Young, handsome, sophisticated, composed, erudite, eloquent and cunning at the same time, Quillen would have been on his way to the top of authority had he not been radical on his political stance.However, Quillen never planned on changing his standpoint. After all, he is still much younger than those aged politicians. In other words, he has the time and patience to wait until the senile ones retire, or even meet their end. Quillen has a mixed feeling about his decision and laments the fact that mankind does not have a long lifespan.The difference of lifespan fully embodies human’s individual quality. Compared to other intelligent beings, humans do not have the ability to pass on their potentials and are not blessed by magic talents. In times of chaos, it is necessary for humans to depend on the protection of the Holy Hall to secure their land, food and lives.“Nowadays, even though we humans have occupied most of the continents and mastered magic and technology that is on par with the divine power, we are still facing threats from other species. From demons in the abyss and the elves in the woods to demigods in the Holy Hall, they have what it takes to wipe out all human beings. We have to stay alert. The allies today might be our enemies tomorrow!”This was part of Quillen’s speech during the promotion of “Theory on Foreign Threats”. Starting out as an ordinary citizen, he works his way up in his political career. His political standpoint not only wins the voters’ recognition, but also earns the support from the radicals. But more importantly, he received the invitation from the “Shadow Hand”.“Purge the aliens! Cleanse the world!” As an extreme racist organization, the Shadow Hand advocates even more radical concepts than Quillen does. They believe that violence is the only means to eradicate those imposing threats to mankind, so that humans can obtain absolute control of the world.Quillen does not reply the envoy from the mysterious organization right away. He is thrilled at the offer as he is able to work with those who share his thoughts, but he also realizes that he still lacks the power and strength to reach his ultimate goal. He simply cannot afford to put all his eggs in one basket.The envoy seems to have anticipated the outcome, so he presents on a desk a series of proofs manifesting the power of the organization. From politics to economics, and technology to military, members of this mysterious organization are virtually everywhere.The envoy’s sincerity and the desk of proof seems to affect Quillen’s thinking: he can almost envisage a bright future ahead of him. At that moment, in order to achieve his dream, he has to take risks.Since then, being a councilor in the federal committee is just a disguise. To Quillen, recruiting new members for the Shadow Hand and training killers are his main duties to pledge allegiance. In return, the organization paves the way for his career, thus pushing him all the way up to the leading position.Quillen, a decent, discreet politician by day, and an extremist who does what it takes to exterminate every alien by night, lives under his motto: survival of the fittest!",Quillen_image.jpg
Elsu,['marksman'],"['Sentinel', 'Snipe', 'Disengage']","When the rich mines had been completely exhausted, Mildar, the city that stands on steel, lost its glory.Industrial expansion once brought fortune to Mildar, yet the mines were now depleted, and industry dwindled. Opportunistic industrialists plucked the very last resources as they departed, and the city was left with myriads of industrial waste. Expediency is only human nature, and it explains why the citizens migrated to other cities after the economic recession and the abrupt environmental change. Of course, some stubborn people stayed behind, and Elsu was one of them.As a native Mildarian, Elsu had a strong bond with the city. His parents died in a plague not long after he was born. Thankfully, Mildar was under rapid development and citizens had many social benefits, so Elsu was raised in an orphanage. He aspired to become a “City Guardian” in order to repay the city.With outstanding academic performance and excellent archery skills, Elsu became a decorated City Guardian. Even though he looked serious all the time, he was loved and respected by his comrades. His shots also never missed their targets during the war. In just 3 years, Elsu’s special team not only completed all military missions with excellent results, but also were praised by the Federal Council on various occasions.Therefore, when the authority decided to abandon Mildar, the Federal council issued an order to move this brilliant special team to handle more difficult scouting missions behind enemy lines. The second Darkness Invasion was winding down, and as a member of the Allied Powers, the Federation of the Free invested all they had into this epic war.“This is the greatest war in human history! Together with our allies, we will send those filthy devils back to the abyss!” Spirited, every solider participated in the war to fight for glory and honor.Except Elsu.“Do you know what you are doing? Look at the badge on your chest! You are betraying it!” Facing criticism from his comrades, Elsu seemed deflated, “I have sworn to protect this city until I die. I will keep my promise even though it is already in ruins. I’m sorry, but I’m afraid I can’t fight with you anymore.”The majority of the soldiers could not fathom Elsu’s emotional attachment to the city. Even though Elsu was ridiculed as “coward”, “chickenhearted” or “draft dodger”, he still insisted on leaving the military. His comrades departed Mildar angrily as Elsu watched them leave.“You don’t have to do this. Mildar is done for.” Moren, who also chose to stay, said to Elsu. After the war of Fort Alchemy, Moren returned to his hometown, Mildar.“Then, why did you come back?” asked Elsu.I'm old, you're young. Don't ask me why. Moren waved his hand and walked away.Everyone has a reason, thought Elsu as he watched his friends depart.“But if one day they are in trouble, I will protect them with everything I have!”",Elsu_image.jpg
Y'bneth,['tank'],"['Wicked Thorns', 'Branching Out', ""Nature's Realm""]","Time is fair, but also ruthless...Treefolk from the Elborne Woods are steadfast guardians of nature. Like normal trees, Treefolk are born weak saplings, but gradually grow to their impressive size by weathering tens to hundreds of years of relentless storms. Their lifespan gives them strong branches, lush leaves, and a calm, tranquil personality. Y'bneth, however, is an exception. He is a curious soul, always eager to learn.Be it fairies that speed past, the birds roaming the skies, beasts seeking food, or the swimming fish—Y'bneth wanted to befriend them all. He had visited every nook and cranny of the vast Elborne Woods, but he did not wish to stop there. The more he learned from his new friends, the less he realized he actually knew. Finally, the day came when he decided that it was time he ventured into the outside world.All other Treefolk considered him insane, and even the fairies found this decision a bit rash. The birds brought news from afar: humans were expanding their territory, often waging war against the beasts on the borders in order to fulfill their greed. The creatures hidden in the dark were getting ready to make their move as well. All in all, the world outside was not a peaceful one. Y'Beth began questioning his own choice. Should he follow his heart, or should he listen to his friends? The Tree of Dawn, he concluded, was the only one who could provide him with an answer.The Tree of Dawn was the greatest creation of the Creator Himself, as well as the perfect landmark for gods to use when returning to Athanor. It was a miracle that sealed the Rift between worlds, the origin of all life. For Y'bneth, visiting the Tree of Dawn was much like coming home to his mother. The Tree of Dawn had been slumbering for more than ten thousand years due to having spent all its energy sealing up the Rift, and all who wish to communicate with it must do so via its dreams. Treefolk have a natural advantage here—all they need to do is send their roots deep down into the earth underneath their feet, and they are able to connect with the Tree of Dawn easily through the all-encompassing underground network.Once Y'bneth explained the reason for his visit, he was brought into the Tree of Dawn's dream, where he experienced the dewy spring, the bright summer, the chilling autumn and the lonely winter. He saws all four seasons pass by, again and again, in an endless cycle. He saw so much, yet all this time the Tree of Dawn said not a word. That was the answer he was seeking: go with the flow of nature, and all will be well. Y'bneth, therefore, set off on his way. His friends gave up on trying to convince him otherwise, and even held a grand farewell ceremony for him. He received a parting gift from the Tree of Dawn as well—a branch from the legendary tree itself.Following the river, Y'bneth headed east on foot until he arrived at the Moonlit Plains, where servants of darkness had appeared from underground and began wreaking havoc on the beautiful land. The Moonlit Plains, once a thriving environment for flora and fauna, was now dying at an alarming speed. That is when it struck Y'bneth what the true purpose of his journey was. He pulled out the branch from the Tree of Dawn, and used it to cultivate a new forest on the Moonlit Plains, which he named Verno—protection in ancient Elvish.The lavish Verno Woods has brought the natural balance back to the world as well as become a shield that protects all from the raining arrows and blasting magic. With the birth of the Afata Alliance, the Verno Woods soon grew into an outpost for fighting off the dark invasion. Y'bneth's journey ended here—he travels no more and instead opts to stay in the Verno Woods, now his second home.The strategically advantageous location of the Verno Woods makes it a busy hub where travelers often pass by, an ideal situation for Y'bneth, who loves to listen to the travelers' stories. Here, he fulfills his dream to learn more about the world, while also fulfilling his destiny to protect the peace on the land—a destiny endowed upon him by the Tree of Dawn.I guard my home and all that lives within it!",Y'bneth_image.jpg
Annette,['support'],"['Gust Force', 'Wind Cuffs', 'Hurricane Wall']","Nightfall is when Annette's work of the day begins.Magic wand? Check. Crystal ball? Check. Energizing potions? Check—those had become a necessity ever since she nodded off that one time in the middle of the night. Fully prepared, Annette exited her minimalist but cozy attic and emerged under the starry night skies, where she silently surveyed the sleepy little seaside town.Seasoul Town is surrounded by the ocean on three sides. For the past few decades, typhoons and tsunamis had been abundant due to the weather changes brought by the currents and the Abyssal Rift. The fishermen had been praying for decades that the Magic Council would send over a powerful sorcerer to aid them, yet the few sorcerers remaining never had time for this border town with its meager population, especially when the frontline in the south was facing increasingly severe attacks. The town had, therefore, become a location for apprentice sorcerers to try their hand at magic instead.The fishermen here need me!Instead of choosing to intern with the Humans or in another prosperous city, Annette arrived alone at Seasoul Town. Having studied Wind Magic and Astrology, this apprentice sorcerer was an excellent choice for dealing with the weather problems. She was capable of spotting even the smallest signs in the complicated stars to predict typhoons, and could easily notify the fishermen to be prepared before weather disasters occurred.However, what the fishermen were really looking for was a legendary sorcerer who could repel disasters with their magic, which Annette was not—she couldn't technically even use her magic, in fact, for apprentices were not permitted to do so outside of Academy grounds. Therefore, instead of a respectable sorcerer, the fishermen saw Annette as a silly girl who spouted nonsense, even if her weather predictions over the past fifty days had always been on the spot, with only two incorrect forecasts marring her records.One of those errors occurred on a sunny day, where she predicted a storm. The fishermen, boats parked and windows barred, stayed inside for the whole day, until the sun came up the next morning, and they realized Annette was incorrect.The other time was when Annette fell asleep at midnight. The night sky showed signs of sunny weather before she dozed off, and she did not see the changes in the stars during her exhausted slumber. The storm came the next evening and the fishermen on their way back to shore were caught off guard, struggling in the waves with their boats of fresh catches. Fortunately, the storm was not a big one, and Annette was able to help a little to compensate for her mistake. It was a bit of a scare for everyone, but at least there were no casualties.The two mistakes, however, led to multiple complaints against Annette. As the Academy was an educational organization directly under the Council, it was important for them to uphold the honor and credibility of both the Council and the school itself. The professors, therefore, sent orders for Annette to return to school and retake her classes.As a result, this was Annette's final night at work.If you asked Annette, she didn't exactly like the idea of leaving. Though the attic she was staying in, hastily provided by poor fishermen, was much less comfortable than the Academy dorms, she felt at home there. What's more, before arriving in town, she promised herself to use her magic to help those in need, and she still hadn't quite fulfilled that promise yet.As a novice, Annette actually did quite a good job. Astrology is no simple subject, and a 4% error rate was rather impressive. However, Annette herself understood that a 4% error rate on paper was completely different from a 4% error rate in real life. To the fishermen, the 4% error rate could mean death.Gazing up into the night sky, dotted with stars big and small, Annette recalled the encounter years ago.It was night, and Annette was in the library. She was the only one there, besides a lady with kind eyes. She knew she had to study hard, for despite excelling in Magic Theory, she was failing her field courses, and failing badly. At the end of the semester, she was the only one in her entire class who still could not cast a proper magic spell. This, she was all too aware, could very well get her expelled.She tried to seek answers in books, but nothing seemed to help. Seeing the encouraging eyes of the lady, she finally decided to ask her for advice.I once had a friend who was horrible at Magic Theory—yet he's one of the best sorcerers I've ever met, the lady said.Annette stared, mouth agape.The woman smiled. Like you, I was shocked, so I spied on him to see how he usually practices his magic. And what do you think I saw? My friend was dancing in the flames, much like a fire-loving fairy. He danced with abandon, as if the flames were his whole world.True magic is not simply words. Burying yourself in books all day will not bring you closer to the truth. You should become friends with magic so that it is willing to help you when you need it.Years later, Annette finally found out the identity of that mystery woman at an award ceremony. Sephera was one of the founders of the Magic Council, and a legend. As Annette accepted the trophy from Sephera, the lady's wise words were replaying in her head: Become friends with magic, and use it to help the people in need.That was what originally brought Annette to Seasoul Town.All of a sudden, there seemed to be something going on in the stars. Annette watched on in horror when the darkest Death Star, for a brief second, shined pale purple and faded away again. Just a mere second, but Annette's sharp eyes managed to capture it. A tempest was brewing—a tempest born from the Rift far away and is gradually taking over the oceans.Ruthless. Deadly.My friend, I need your help now! With impending doom on the horizon, Annette opted to ignore the orders of the Academy. She hopped onto her broom and soared towards the storm like a fearless knight.The next morning, the fishermen awakened to see their boats in tatters. Annette laid on the ground, completely exhausted. Though the townspeople did not see Annette's courageous actions, they could still guess from the sight in front of them what she had been through the previous night. What a great sorcerer! they said. Being ignorant, they had almost sent away their most loyal ally—but luckily she was still right here with them.There was still time, though, to repent.The apprentice sorcerer, there to replace Annette, was told to leave by the fishermen. He had no idea what was happening, but the Mayor gave him a handwritten letter of gratitude, complete with the handprints of all the fishermen, to bring back to the Academy. The Mayor not only praised Annette for what she had done, but also recommended that the Academy promote her to the role of Official Sorcerer.He also revealed another piece of news: the fishermen of Seasoul were planning to build a magical spire for Annette. They were but a small town lacking funds and manpower, yet they still pledged to see this project through even if it would take three generations to complete, for Annette had already promised them that she was there to stay for good.Now, whenever the Mayor mentions Annette in letters, he adds a title to convey his respect.Lord Annette.",Annette_image.jpg
Airi,['assassin'],"['Spin', 'Shadow', 'Ryuu']","Dragons dwelled inside the body of their newest descendant, Airi the Kunoichi. Her every breath seemed to exhibit the power of dragons.Many ninja clans had only come into existence recently, but the mysterious Steel Dragons had been around for generations. This reclusive clan of ninjas loyally protect the peace and tranquility of the realm using the power of the ancient dragons. As the leader of a new generation of ninjas, Airi had not only inherited the title of Kunoichi, her incredible talents had also earned the approval of the Ancient Dragon. She has been bestowed with the almighty Dragon's Mark as well.As night engulfed day, the elite Ninjas led by Airi rushed to save the Temple of Light from the evil forces that surrounded it. Using her shadow clone ability, Airi passed with ease through the savage bombardment of black magic. The iron wall made up of thousands of Fallen crumpled beneath her feet. She transformed herself into a sharp blade and hurled herself straight at Maloch, the commander of the Demon Army, leaving a bloody trail of corpses in her wake.Airi took more and more wounds as she fought her way towards Maloch. By the time she finally reached him, she had defeated nearly all of his demon guards. Airi was punished for her actions with three more mortal wounds. With her strength depleted, Airi realized that she wouldn't stand a chance in a drawn-out battle, so she activated the last bit of power in her Dragon's Mark, raised her blade and sliced at Maloch. In that moment, Maloch was unable to lift his own weapon. He was so overcome by the unleashed dragon spirit that he could only use his demon wings to shield himself from Airi's attacks.The blade rose and fell. Blood hotter than lava gushed out from a wound in Maloch's chest and the impregnable demon wings were tattered. The force from Airi's blade had completely stripped the invincible commander of his combat abilities. Maloch was forced to return to the demon abyss to recover and, in turn, left the demon army their demise.Airi's determination, demonstrated in this battle, immediately earned her the respect of everyone. Even the most despicable of demons could not hide their fear of Airi's blade.",Airi_image.jpg
Aleister,['mage'],"['Magic Barrier', 'Matrix of Woe', 'Magic Prison']","We might not be able to take care of the problem, but we can take care of the person who brought it up.People may have forgotten that Aleister, the infamous crook, was once a candidate for the Temple of Light. With Yorn the Hotshot, they were hailed as the Sons of Light at the time and had the most potential to be fully inducted into the Temple. Despite Aleister's intelligence, he didn't possess a strong will and he fell into the darkness due to Veera's charm.Though on a different note, Aleister's brilliance had a huge impact on the war. His endless tricks and traps helped the Fallen to defeat the resistance forces time after time.To eliminate the master think tank behind the dark power, Yorn left glory behind and led an elite team deep into enemy territory to assassinate Aleister. His near-perfect plan was foiled by Aleister, who turned the tables on him and nearly trapped him in the abyss forever.Are you smart enough to go up against me?",Aleister_image.jpg
Alice,['support'],"['Sunshine', 'Friendship', 'Hissy Fit']","Alice was the youngest maiden to ever serve in the temple, which was why she was allowed to refuse work and spend her days frolicking with all manner of innocent creatures. The other maidens doted on her, akin to a mother's love for her child.As childlike and innocent as she was, the word fear was not understood by her. Even in the presence of the temple leader, she did not hold back her playfulness. The smile that she shared with everyone from the bottom of her heart never failed to win people over.But it would be foolhardy to underestimate her because of her kind-hearted nature. When the Fallen invaded, Alice left the temple and joined the resistance. Her participation, skill, and magic, greatly bolstered the army's combat strength. With her outstanding contribution, Alice received the title of The Princess.Don't get on the wrong side of this little princess.This warning was always wise to bear in mind. Indeed, all of the enemies that Alice defeated serve to underpin this advice, further proving her prowess. If you were fortunate enough to witness Alice during battle, you would be amazed at how one so small can unleash such a godly force with cataclysmic effects.There is no bravery without fear!",Alice_image.jpg
Amily,['warrior'],"['Kickblade', 'Combo', 'Enrage']","Amily is a traitor.In her last trial, she worked with three other candidates and killed more than ten supervisors, including the instructor. The four traitors paid a high price and were drenched in blood. However, this was just the beginning. Soon after they left the scene, they had to go into hiding in order to escape from the organization.Amily did not have to do that. She could have become the next top assassin in Hands of Shadow by simply following the orders of the organization and slay all other competitors in the trial. The leader of the organization, Quillen, favored her and even promised her a glamorous public identity with fame, wealth and power.As an orphan, Amily could not have asked for more, but she chose to escape from all of this. It was not just for the freedom she had always longed for, but more for her belief that her long-lost younger sister is still waiting for her somewhere in the world. She had thought about asking the organization for help, and put extraordinary effort in her training to give her more leverage, but gave up the idea.The Hands of Shadow is not a charity. They gather orphans from war, famine and disasters, provide them with food, lodging and cruel training. They fight and kill one another to become seeds, so they can be turned into deadly and obedient killing machines.There is no place for emotion in the organization. Amily learned it from the scar on her waist. In her first trial, she stood in front of a friend to protect him, but he stabbed her in return. Since then, she kept to herself and became quieter, more cautious and diligent. In return, she was able to survive every trial and earn the organization’s favor.Many supervisors also trusted Amily for her hatred against the non-humans. She lost her family and everything else because her homeland was destroyed by the Lokheim demons. The orc legions and Demigod of the Veda were not innocent, either. As an organization extremists, the Hands of Shadow is determined to eliminate all non-humans that pose threats to humans. They thought an orphan like Amily would be easily brain-washed. In fact, she did agree with some of their teachings, but she had always retained some sense of humanity, thanks to her longing for her sister.Amily made a promise in front of her dying parents that she would find her sister. Ten years had passed since then, she lived in shadow and her hands dripped with the blood of her peers. She learned to build a wall around her heart, and she never forgot that promise. It was like a seed, and each time Amily mourned her parents, missed her sister, long for freedom or survived another trial, the seed would grow. So, with all the skills and endurance developed over the years, she has shattered her shackles.Freedom tastes great!",Amily_image.jpg
Arduin,['warrior'],"['Rend', 'Undying Protector', 'Cull']","Arduin was the leader of mankind trained by the Vedä.Brave and perseverant, Arduin was the epitome of a great leader in the public's eye. His speech was so affectionate and evoking, it attracted young and passionate rebel warriors to join his legion, fighting for a higher goal.Instructed by the Vedä, Arduin once regarded Thane as his rival. He decided to fight Thane for honor, but won Thane's admiration with his fearless combat style and confident tactics. After years of collaboration, Arduin finally accepted Thane as an ally and their friendship grew. The duo was fundamental to the rebels' victory. The Fallen were forced to withdraw their defense lines and retreat to Inferi. In the last battle, Arduin and Thane quarreled for the first time in a long time. Arduin wanted to keep on battling, in hopes of obliterating the dark forces and bringing back the long-awaited peace, while Thane thought such an action would only devastate what they had achieved so far.Failing to persuade him, Arduin abandoned Thane and, together with his warriors and supporting Vedän squads, marched into Inferi to hunt down the remaining Fallen and demons. Yet, Arduin's legion was misled to the Icy Terrain by the cunning Veera. She ignited the frost fire, hoping to annihilate the entire legion. Feeling a deep regret of his own decision, Arduin strode through the frost fire and created a storm by swinging his axe, attempting to create a safe passage for his warriors.Thanks to Arduin's resourcefulness, a few soldiers managed to survive, but many of their fellows perished in the unforgiving frost fire. Even Arduin himself was scorched in battle, but was saved by the Vedä-blessed armor. Despite the fact that Arduin swung his axe blindly, he managed to kill any enemies who dared to come close.Veera swiftly stepped in and stopped the Fallen from taking revenge. She poured frost fire into Arduin's crippling body, rendering the holy seal of Vedä useless. Soon, Arduin's body was burned to ashes, and though his spirit remained, it was marked with a dark seal by Veera. Freezing frost fire replaced the Holy Force and became the sole driving force of the armor.Those who lament the loss of Arduin will never expect to see their legendary hero again like this!",Arduin_image.jpg
Arthur,['warrior'],"['Righteous Fervor', 'Holy Guard', 'Deep Impact']","The chaos-ending Sword of Justice, and the invincible leader that brought order to the orderless!With the holy sword in his hand and righteousness in his heart, Arthur was the first true leader in human history. He was born in an age when faith had collapsed and the world was shrouded in darkness. Facing frenzied beasts and bloodthirsty demons, the humans lacked not only the strength to defend themselves, but also guidance from the gods, which could have prevented their civil wars. This era of turmoil persisted until Arthur rose. Preaching principles of justice and honor, he started down the path of order and discipline as a knight.Arthur's chivalry was well-received and admired by all, drawing brave human warriors from far and wide to pledge their allegiance to him. Under his leadership, they formed a valiant order of knights trained in the art of war. They marched under the banner of justice and valor in the name of Arthur. They toured the land, exterminating evil along the way. Most importantly, they established order and peace amidst the darkness, ensuring humanity's survival.The deeds of the Order greatly impeded the demon legion's invasion plans. Arthur had become a thorn in Maloch's side, and his knights were attacked at every turn. However, the Order was not shaken one bit. Arthur and his knights resolutely stood their ground. Their resilience and persistence inspired all.Young men flocked at the opportunity to become a part of the Order. Any vacant positions in their ranks were promptly filled. This band of brothers, loyal to both the chivalric spirit and their leader gradually grew into a force to be reckoned with. Humans, long looked down on by the other races, were finally earning the recognition and respect of all.Even their age-long rival, the Afata, extended the hand of friendship to Arthur. The secluded Veda brought the blessings of the gods upon the Order and its knights. Arthur and his chivalric spirit gave courage to humankind and his successors, notably Thane, to pass on the torch from one generation to the next.The radiance of the Sword of Justice shall cast its light upon the path of every knight!",Arthur_image.jpg
Arum,['tank'],"['Lion Tamer', 'Uncaged', 'Snare']","“Leo, do you think I'm stubborn?”Feeling the warmth from the lion cub, Arum finally calmed down. As unhappy as she was about the arranged marriage, running away from it might have brought more trouble and grief to her father. Exhausted both mentally and physically, she finally fell asleep in the forest, a place she called home, next to Leo, whom she trusted with her life.Ten years ago, Arum arrived in Tamuq with her father Varian, who took a position as a guard. He climbed the ranks swiftly, and was soon awarded a General position by the Federal Council. Life did not remain peaceful, however. The conflict between the Federation and the Verno Woods escalated and Tamuq, a small town unfortunately located smack on the border, became the ideal location for both factions to duke it out.Arum could be thoughtful and understanding when she wanted to, and she knew how much pressure her father was under. But how could she throw away her love for the Verno Woods, where she met and saved sweet little Leo, and the guardian pact she had sealed with the spirit beasts of the Lion Clan, just to support her father? Many had, in fact, shown hostility towards Arum because of her extraordinary past and fence-sitting position—people are extra sensitive nowadays after all. If not for Varian's unblemished reputation, perhaps Arum would have already been thrown into jail for colluding with the enemy.With the town on the brink of war, Varian forced Arum to wed Rahms. It was for her own protection, Arum knew, as her father didn't expect to come out alive from the battle between the two races, and the only way to keep her safe was to make her the wife of Rahms, the only eligible bachelor with noble blood in Tamuq. Once wed to Rahms, Arum would gain all immunities exclusive to the nobility and could no longer be targeted by the public's accusations. This would give her a safer and brighter future, even if Rahms wasn't exactly the nicest and most blameless man out there.However, now that Arum has ran away, Varian's elaborate plans have gone to waste and the townspeople were rapidly losing their trust in him. They believed he orchestrated this in order to give his daughter the opportunity to flee into the Verno Woods. “Shameless traitor,” the enraged townies cried. They finally decide to imprison Varian, who was burdened with too much guilt to try and justify his actions.Arum was distressed-too distressed. In the end she snuck back to town and returned home to find that her father was no longer there—only guards awaited, faces impassive. After learning her father has been sent to prison, Arum surrendered under one condition: that she was to be placed in the same cell as her father. The guards ended up letting her have her way, as she was, after all, the daughter of the once highly esteemed Varian.Arum reunited with her father in prison. No longer a stoic and majestic general, Varian looked gaunt and listless. Arum heard her own heart break several times over.“My child, why have you returned? They...they'll send us both to the gallows!”“I'm so sorry, Father. You wouldn't have been here if not for my stubbornness and selfishness,” Arum sobbed, kneeling in front of her father and lamenting her thoughtless actions.“No, I'm the one who's at fault. If I hadn't forced you to get married, you wouldn't have-”“Father, no more crying! Trust me, I'll get you out of here!”Cold determination overtook Arum's dainty features. This was the first time she has ever summoned her powers, limitless powers she had inherited from the spirit beasts. Her whole demeanor changed. Out of the void, savage spirit beasts appeared at her feet, radiating danger, dark gazes piercing. Varian had long known his daughter's ties with the Woods, but never did he realize that she was capable of controlling such incredible, mystic powers. Within a few seconds, all powers bestowed by the spirit beasts had manifested on Arum, making her the new Guardian of the Lions. Arum was now a member of the Woods, and therefore no longer a human. Arum had never attempted to activate her powers, not knowing how to explain them to her father, but drastic times call for drastic measures. She needed power to break out of the prison, to defeat all in her way, and to save her precious father!“Spirits of all Beasts, the time has come to fight back!”",Arum_image.jpg
Astrid,['warrior'],"['Spin Slash', 'Fearless Charge', 'Dire Blow']","I will become your sword and cut through thorns for you. When Astrid bent the knee in front of Thane and to take her vows, she was not yet 18. But as the bearer of the famous sword Embertrail and the legitimate heir of the Duke of Roses, Astrid took up the mantle imposed upon her by history. She raised the Flaming Rose standard high and stood next to Thane, showing the world the allegiance of an old noble house to the new king.With Astrid's support, the doubts that followed Arduin's death eventually quieted and people started to reflect on the failure of Arctica. Even though Astrid's father and brother died in the war, she did not pay any mind to gossip and whispers from the Temple. Her support in Thane's ascension provided some much-needed stability in times of conflict.In return, Thane awarded unprecedented honor to the Rose family, and Astrid became the kingdom's first duchess. But before she could do anything with her territory, dark powers returned with Taara leading the charge. Arduin and Mina, corrupted by dark power, were spotted among their ranks.Astrid knew that the murderous leader was one of those responsible for her father's and brother's deaths. She could not wait to join the battle and avenge them, but Thane gently stopped her. Looking at the girl with affection and care, Thane said, You have done enough for me. I shall take care of the rest.My lord, I don't think you understand, declared Astrid with her head held high, showing resolve that no man of her age would ever possess. I took my vows as a knight. Dukes can wait in their castles for news of victory, but knights must charge into battle! With that said, she unclasped her crimson mantle, unsheathed Embertrail and led her knights to war.My resolve will never waver!",Astrid_image.jpg
Azzen'Ka,['mage'],"['Sand Punch', 'Dust Devil', 'Sand Wraith']","I am one with the wind and the sand.A mysterious being, Azzen'Ka wandered the desert and was worshiped as a god by some. Anyone who wished to pass through the desert must make an offering to him or be forever lost. The treacherous terrain had isolated the desert from the rest of the world, and the endless storms have prevented the other gods from entering, leaving Azzen'Ka as the true ruler of the desert.Thane had more than once led his army into the desert in attempts to conquer this sandy realm beyond the control of the gods. However, failure after failure had made it clear that Azzen'Ka had nothing to fear from anyone in his domain. Even the Grim Reaper himself had no choice but to admit that the desert was beyond his control. Although he was confident he could defeat Azzen'Ka, he did not consider himself capable of pacifying the sandstorms.Numerous writings accused Azzen'Ka of being evil, yet travelers reported that Azzen'Ka would guarantee their safety as long as they make an offering to him. This made him more honest and trustworthy than any of the gods in the heavens. It was for this reason that opinions of him were extremely polarized. Some feared and respected him as a god, while others simply loathed him. Azzen'Ka, of course, could not care less.The gods are forbidden from my domain.",Azzen'Ka_image.jpg
Baldum,['tank'],"['Wild Charge', 'Wild Stomp', 'Wild Prison']","He had bones like steel and muscles like boulders. He was stout, righteous and agile, with strength that rivaled the gods.All centaurs were born warriors, and Baldum was the most impressive of them all. He was a legend of the savage eras, not only bearing witness to the beginning and end of the war between Humans and Afata and the two Darkness Invasions, but also faithfully guarding all living beings on the Moonlight Plains with his Cosmic Totem.The mystical Cosmic Totem, known to have seen it all from the very birth of the universe, was actually an Andura Shard, holding the power of time. It was how Baldum remained immortal, never to decay or die despite all the decades that had passed. However, the Totem's powers protected Baldum only and no one else—thus, he was doomed to watch his clan, his people, depart from the living world one by one through the years, leaving Baldum as the only centaur in Athanor.For a long period, people believed that Baldum was but an ancient myth, and even most inhabitants of the Elborne Woods were unsure whether Baldum was still alive. Not until Volkath, the Dark Lord, made his comeback with his Lokheim army, were the mortals able to truly see him with their very own eyes. He had his back towards everyone, but seeing him fight his way against the swarms of Lokheim was enough to raise the morale of all Afata troops, who lived the rest of their lives with the image of this magnificent warrior engraved in their minds.After I buried my last relative, I ran twelve laps around the crypt according to our clan customs. My forefathers said that by making the ground quake with our hooves, we would awaken Mother Earth, who would come call her children home.I've been to many funerals in my life—too many, but that was the most lonely one. No clan members ran at my side, no clan members sang the dirge with me. The whistling wind was my only companion. That, and the Cosmic Totem in my arms.That was when Y'bneth brought me a gift from the Tree of Dawn—a segment of its roots. I planted it on the burial grounds of my people, to commemorate the brave battles they had fought.Y'bneth was skilled indeed. It was a mere root then, but he cultivated it into the Verno Woods we see now.Through chatting with Baldum after the battle, people finally learned more about his tragic past. The Y'bneth he mentioned was, in fact, the Ancient Treefolk who brought the Verno Woods to life. He brought to Baldum not only a gift from the Tree of Dawn but also a request: for him to head towards the glacial wildlands to the north of the Moonlight Plains and stand guard over the Abyssal Fissure near the foot of the sacred Mt. Orpheus.That was how Baldum spent the past thousand years—all alone, in the abandoned wildlands, desolate and friendless. At one point, he nearly forgot that he was once a warrior. With the memory buried deep, he simply sat there, reminiscing about the good old days when he and his clan members ran around, laughing, under the orange sunsets. But as soon as the Lokheim showed signs of abnormal activity and the flames of war neared his homeland, the born warrior immediately regained the battle instincts that ran deep in his blood.These woods sprouted from land fertilized with the flesh and blood of my clan. Every flower, every tree, is my family. As long as I am alive and breathing, you dirty wretches shall not pass!",Baldum_image.jpg
Batman,['assassin'],"['Forearm Strike', 'Batarang', 'Dark Knight']","Batman has become a symbol of dark justice that hangs over Gotham City. Born into wealth as Bruce Wayne, he witnessed his parents murdered in front of him as a boy. This tragedy transformed his entire existence, reshaping him into the consummate crime-fighter. Wayne traveled the world for a decade, training his mind and body relentlessly, pushing himself to the limits of human capacity, all in preparation of donning the mantle of the caped crusader. His years of tremendous effort have left him as not only the world's greatest detective, but with a physical prowess that has yet to be bested by any foe.As Batman, he has consistently been forced into battle in an array of alternate worlds, dimensions and universes. And it was through a bruising encounter with Zephys that Batman pieced together the existence of Athanor. Zephys collided into Earth, bringing with him a power of unimaginable magnitude. He had come to subdue the earth and build a new world. One that would be subjugated by Athanor and be forced to provide fresh troops for its eternal war.During the tumult, Batman found himself chasing Zephys, passing through countless worlds and fragments of time. Finally catching up to him, Batman sought to end Zephys' dark plot right then and there. However, he just could not find an opening to end the fight. Suddenly, the hero Valhein appeared, under orders from Thane, to investigate the strange rumblings of doom. With his aid, Batman finally beat back Zephys and temporarily banished him back to his realm.Traveler, welcome to Athanor, Valhein whispered in a deep, but urgent voice. Batman felt drawn towards this mysterious new land, to understand just what sort of role it would play in his destiny. Stepping into the light, he found himself in Thane's court. The resplendent king sat high above the rest as a gloomy pall hung over the room. He thanked the Dark Knight for subduing Zephys and handed him a shining gem, a fragment of Andura.Upon touching the gem, Batman experienced a vision of fire and despair. Gotham lay in ruins, consumed by flames that licked the air. Its inhabitants were being led towards the darkness in chains. The old and feeble were disposed of. The young and strong were ripped away from their loved ones and cowed. And above all of this sat a malevolent shadow that seemed to glow brighter than the very flames swallowing the city. Then, at a snap of its immaterial fingers, the light extinguished, and life existed no more.Batman stood unmoving, transfixed in the horror. This isn't real, is it? were his only words. This must be some sort of trick. However, the solemn shake of Thane's head and his mournful eyes, brought ice into the Dark Knight's veins. Thoughts raced through Bruce's mind. What is this madness? What is this despair? Thane finally spoke It is what will come to pass, if we sit idle. He continued, The Andura fragment you hold must be returned whole. It has the power to create, and a devastating power to destroy. It matters not where your world lies in time and space, all is connected to Athanor.And with that, Batman felt himself hurdled back to Gotham, to ponder upon the choices that lay ahead. Then with quiet and steeled determination, he fought. With Lucius and Alfred's aid, he modified his armaments to prepare himself for the coming battle. His friends worried for him. They were unsure of the threats lying in wait for Bruce. But as we all know from experience, never underestimate the Batman.",Batman_image.jpg
Butterfly,['assassin'],"['Whirlwind', 'Sword Propel', 'Backstab']","“What should I do after the war is over?” On cold nights, Butterfly's sword emits a crimson light that radiates a sense of warmth.“Survival is never easy for people like me, the people who feed on dirt and blood. I have no time to think about anything else,” her cold voice scoffed from the shadows. Even after several straight days of fighting, Butterfly showed no sign of fatigue. As a well-trained mercenary, she is capable of retaining and recovering her stamina throughout an exhausting war.Butterfly was a code name given by her mercenary order. Unlike ordinary, freelance mercenaries, Butterfly was specially trained by the order. As the order's numbers grew, their requests became more complicated as well. Clients started demanding specific requirements of the mercenaries; they insisted on certain abilities, genders, ages, and even appearances. In response, the order assiduously trained Butterfly to cater to the ever-changing requests.According to her contract, Butterfly, as an orphan, was to be raised by the mercenary order and trained in combat. Growing up, she served as a contractor for the association, requiring her to surrender half of the bounty she earned from every assignment as repayment for the order's investment on her, at least until her debt was cleared.Thanks to her efficiency, competence, and the shortage of other female mercenaries, Butterfly was offered the job of protecting Astrid, the youngest daughter of the Duke of Rose. She had completed numerous similar assignments, most of which required her to accompany noblewomen to different events, offering protection while dressed as a servant.Had it not been such a high-paying assignment, she would have chosen a far more exciting task, like hunting a dragon from the abyss, or eliminating the leader of a group of bandits. Anything else seemed a better alternative to entertaining a bunch of socialites, spending the whole night listening to their trivial gossip.Strangely, the new assignment was not as boring as Butterfly had expected. In retrospect, she was thrilled, if not overwhelmed, by the experience, as she was sent to protect Astrid in a fight against the Lokheim army that had defeated Arduin and the Vedan knights.After the deaths of her father and brother, and the siege of her castle, the young Astrid led the Knights of Rose into battle in the name of the Rose family. Butterfly was hired to protect Astrid, and when the fighting had finally stopped, both were left wounded and scarred from days of battle.In fact, according to the regulations of the mercenary order, Butterfly was entitled to abandon the assignment according to the contract's clause regarding “Colossal Changes in Assignment Complexity.” But she carried on with her duties, protecting Astrid in the absence of the late Duke of Rose, who never thought his daughter would have to go to war. When Astrid raised her father's sword, “Embertrail,” Butterfly’s assignment became almost impossible.But Butterfly did not back down, not only because it was her duty, it was also how she worked.“The word 'flee' is not in my vocabulary.”",Butterfly_image.jpg
Chaugnar,['support'],"['Energy Surge', 'Shockwave', 'Chaos Protection']","I am chaos incarnate!Chaugnar was an ancient mammoth that was corrupted by the energy of chaos, which transformed him into his current monstrous form. The chaos had not only changed Chaugnar's appearance, but also warped his mind. In his eyes, existence was merely a constant battle between chaos and order. Life, rules, logic, emotions, and faith meant nothing to him.Any unfortunate souls to come before this sinister being would cower when struck with a feeling more terrifying than the mere meaning of the term. If it hadn't been for a gifted human, who lured Chaugnar into a trap and sealed him in the depths of the Black Sea, this world would have been lost long ago.Yet, the power of chaos could never be exterminated completely. All that a human could do is to fight to weaken Chaugnar, mitigating the threat he posed. However, everyone knew that Chaugnar would eventually break out from his shackles, and his fury would rain upon every corner of this world.I will make you watch as this world is devoured by chaos!",Chaugnar_image.jpg

However, when dealing with Cresht, one would do well to remember that this sea was not called so because of its temperature, but because of the constant chaos beneath its waters, and that he remained at the top of its food chain.Ancient records didn't contain much detail regarding Cresht's origins. The only relevant knowledge that man was able to garner came from a bard's song: A monstrosity rising from the sea's hungry depths; its trident so terrible it brings naught but death. In the War of Man and Beast, Cresht fought fearlessly on the front lines, endlessly tormenting the humans. Surprisingly, Cresht didn't return to the Boiling Sea after the war. Instead, he took it upon himself to pursue higher goals than just devouring the frail and weak.A battle between Gods and Demons must include Cresht!",Cresht_image.jpg
Diaochan,['mage'],"['Chilling Frost', 'Diamond Dust', 'Blizzard']","Diaochan came from very humble beginnings, but her ruthless ambition has taken her far. She was born to a simple handmaiden and was raised under the assumption that she would never exceed her mother’s standing in life. However, Diaochan was blessed with incredible beauty. As she came of age, she became very aware that she was more alluring than the beautiful fountains in the royal cities that she visited.While many men sought her out, even some who pledged to go on chivalric quests to win her hand, Diaochan mastered the art of restraint. She would eye the high lords and smile at them until they requested her service. Once there, she would flirt and tease just long enough to put herself in a position to extract maximum value from another.Eventually, this process left her in the service of a warlord. This warlord, always concerned with the next great conquest, had heard rumblings of a horrendous dragon laying waste to towns and wreaking havoc among the realm. If he could just find a way to defeat this dragon, his real power would be known. All of the other lords would not only praise him, they would also truly fear him. As he trained himself physically for the fight ahead, he gave his servants the task of finding out different ways of slaying the dragon.The warlord had inherited a tremendously well-stocked library, filled with volumes upon volumes of writings on every imaginable subject. Diaochan had been assigned to the magical arts section to scour for any information she could find on defeating a dragon. As she poured over the stacks of spells and potions, her interest in the subject took hold of her. She returned to the library day after day and practiced what she learned under the cover of night. She found herself to be a quick learner and was mastering advanced spells within a year. As she grew in skill, she grew further from her screwed past. She found a sense of peace and purpose on these pages and her newfound identity blossomed.As she neared the end of the library, the camp was attacked by a powerful warrior with dragon blood known as Lu Bu. He tore through the camp, raining terror upon the soldiers. He was outnumbered, but this did not matter; he was absorbed by rage and the outcome turned. Diaochan was curious about the power of this new challenger, and also felt her heart moved by the obvious pain he carried within him.After Lu Bu slew his last enemy, he was still consumed by anger; so much so that the very dragon powers within him failed to respond to his command. The vitriol within him would have taken his heart and devoured him, but a touch from Diaochan’s hand cooled the fires within. She had read about dragon magic in the library, and she knew the spell necessary to still the vengeful thunder within him. He fell in love with Diaochan the first moment he laid eyes on her, and she was fascinated by him.Together, Lu Bu and Diaochan traveled the realm, always by each other’s side. They dwelled in relative peace and for a time things were right and good. This time of tranquility came to an end when the Dragon Father, the very beast who had given Lu Bu his dragon powers, came for Lu Bu. He was furious that Lu Bu had abandoned his previous quest, and commanded that Lu Bu return to his service immediately.But Lu Bu would not leave Diaochan. This infuriated the Dragon Father and sealed the enmity between the two. They clashed in an epic conflict; a stalemate of great magical powers. But the battle turned when Diaochan gave her magic to Lu Bu, allowing him to reach a higher form and smite the Dragon Father.In doing so, Diaochan’s magic bonded with Lu Bu, so that the two are truly of one essence--fused together but not confused. Theirs is the greatest love in all of Athanor, and its power has healed the darkness of anger and vengeance from Lu Bu’s heart. In turn, through her connection with Lu Bu, Diaochan has discovered a great power that will one day define the history of Athanor.",Diaochan_image.jpg
Fennik,['marksman'],"[""Thief's Mark"", 'Rolling Lightning', 'Chain Hammer Cyclone']","“Trust me, thieving's a promising career!”Fennik believed that all professions had their values and reasons for existing. Which was why he stood by the belief that, since he was a thief, he should be the best of them all. Go big or go home, right? This was how Fennik became renowned in the field—his “masterpieces” included the Great Heist of the Luxis City Treasury and the Theft of the Secret Treasures of Fort Alchemy.It was one of Fennik’s principles to never leave empty-handed. He was not one to fail, whether when robbing a bank or simply picking some pockets on the street. Of course, if it turned out that his unfortunate target was dirt-poor, he would not only return what he had stolen afterwards but also add a little something to go with it, which was quite a pleasant surprise for the victim. “A charity act? Nah, I just want my piggies to be well-fed before I butcher ‘em,” Fennik would say. You see, Fennik’s second rule was to never leave the target without means to survive, and the first rule was to aid those in poverty so that they might have a good life someday. After all, the more rich people there were, the more targets to steal from, right? Fennik trusted that raising the life quality of the general public would surely lead to a broader scope of development for those of his trade, and pointlessly accumulating riches would only mean more competition in the thieving industry. “If we thieves become richer than everyone else, we won’t have any targets to steal from except each other, no?”A notorious scoundrel known by all on the Moonlit Plains, Fennik was in fact a better fighter than a strategist, which was saying something as he was quite the strategist. At a young age, he had already out-ranked many of his predecessors on the Wanted List of the Federation of the Free, and eventually even snagged the top spot on the ranking. Even the great Officer Locke couldn’t figure out what to do about him.“Jeez, relax! I’m here for the loot, not your life!”",Fennik_image.jpg

As the executioner, he shackled imprisoned souls, and tore open the offending souls with his teeth to torture them. He had to pay a steep price for this though. The price was that he could no longer digest any food other than souls. He needed to devour souls to satisfy his constant hunger. To stave off hunger during times of peace, he had to ask for help from Zephys and Nakroth; the former harvested souls while the latter past judgment. All guilty souls became his food. After the war broke out, in return for Grakk's strength, Maloch promised Grakk that he could do whatever he wanted with the enemies he captured.The never-ending feast turned Grakk into a war maniac. With every fresh soul consumed, his power grew. He turned all of the things he could not eat into the Fallen to capture more food for him.I… hunger…",Grakk_image.jpg
Ignis,['mage'],"['Fire Crash', 'Rain of Fire', 'Holy Embers']","“The Holy Flame will lead us to the Kingdom of Truth.In the doctrine of the Veda, the Holy Flame was the symbol of light and truth. As the guardian of the Holy Flame, Ignis had long relied on his abundant knowledge and unwavering faith to lead the believers along the path of light. It was for this reason that he was widely known as the Guide. However, before all this, Ignis had been an ordinary Temple scholar.Obsessed with the pursuit of truth, Ignis spent all his time studying in the Veda's Tower of Contemplation. He read countless ancient texts, among which he discovered the long forgotten Holy Flame manipulation spells. Unfortunately, the Holy Flame burned out a century ago, making his discovery worthless. Everyone in the Temple lamented this fact, but Ignis was delighted, for his study of the Holy Flame had brought him one step closer to the Kingdom of Truth that he had dreamed of for so long.Although it could not be put into practice, Ignis' discovery sent shockwaves through the forces of darkness that lurked just out of sight. No one knew what would happen with his next discovery, and it might just break the balance between light and dark. Commanded by Volkath, the Dark Lord, the Demon Army mounted an attack on the Veda, during which the scorching flames of hell engulfed the Tower of Contemplation. Terrified, most of the scholars fled, but the resolute Ignis refused to leave, desperate to protect the precious texts.“If this is to be my fate, then bury me in the Kingdom of Truth along with all the precious knowledge! Death was right in front of him, but Ignis showed no fear. He trusted in his belief till the end, reciting a devout prayer again and again: “The darkness has come. I will sacrifice my body, my heart, my spirit, to bring the sparks of Veda back to the world and light the way!”As Ignis prayed, an orb of pure white flames appeared in his palm and reduced the Demons surrounding him to ashes. “Is...is this the power of the Anointed One?” Ignis wondered for a split second, but he did not remain confused for long. He began to chant the spell to control the Holy Flame—a spell that had long been ingrained in his brain. The flames transformed into a majestic wall that enveloped and protected the Tower of Contemplation. “Death for those that pass the barrier!” And so they did—Ignis stood powerful and resolute, glorious flames in his hand, voice echoing through the walls of the Sacred Mt. Orphean.“Are the seeds of Light Magic sprouting again?” Volkath, who was fighting Ilumia the Seer outside the Palace in the Clouds, noticed the strange phenomenon at the Tower of Contemplation and the sudden morale boost of the Veda troops. This was big—this was out of his control. As unhappy as he was about this, he had to give orders to retreat. That was how the Veda was saved once again.After the battle, Ignis returned to the Tower of Contemplation and continued his journey towards the truth.“Before the truth, the knowledge I possess is but a drop in the ocean.”",Ignis_image.jpg
Ilumia,['mage'],"['Divine Light', 'Banish', 'Cataclysm']","Ilumia had it all: beauty, intelligence, power, glory, and strength. Just as Maloch represented the dark power, Ilumia was the embodiment of light. No hero was above Ilumia. She never showed anyone her true self because she had a more important identity to assume: Goddess of Light.Her elegance, purity, and magic compelled people to believe that Ilumia was the Goddess that brought hope and light to the people. The Temple was founded and expanded on these beliefs. With a revered Goddess, the Temple firmly established the religion, which commanded its fearless followers to resist dark invasions.As the actual power wielder of the Temple, Ilumia knew how to play the game. She managed to wrestle the Temple free from the castle's rule and protect her followers' interests when Thane's power reached its pinnacle. Ilumia lived and breathed power, and she would never give it up willingly.",Ilumia_image.jpg
Jinnar,['mage'],"['Force Orbs', 'Resonance', 'Exuberance']","Embrace the cosmic void.To Jinnar, time is not linear but a matrix formed by countless strands of destiny. Touching any of the lines of fate can cause ripples in the destiny matrix, which in turns changes the person's past, present, and even future. When he was little, Jinnar did not realize the danger of his innate talent. He told everyone without reservation everything he saw, including the crimes that people had yet to commit, and their eventual deaths.At first, people paid no heed to what Jinnar said, until his prophecies started coming true, anxiety and disquiet developing among the crowd, that he was taken seriously. For heaven's sake, the boy is a demon! The inexplicable fear over time aroused begrudging wrath. Blinded by hatred, the people rallied and, led by the village elder, attempted to exorcise Jinnar of the evil inhabiting his body.Jinnar's powers left the people of his home shocked and startled. He was confined in a dungeon while they sought assistance from the provincial capital. Incarcerated and in despair, Jinnar had a vision: He was promoted to the altar as an acknowledgment of his unique talent. Fiddling gracefully the strands of destiny with his immaculate fingers, he was in control of the world.What a stunning talent! I can still feel the destiny ripples spreading from afar. All of a sudden, a ray of light lit up the dark dungeon. Echoing the corridor was a harmonious melody, composed by a gentle female voice, along with a brisk rhythm of high heels stepping on the stairs.What… The vibration of the destiny matrix has subsided. Jinnar once again found himself on the altar, and his fingertips were entwined by countless destiny strands, which triggered the tumbling of the matrix.My name is Ilumia. Maybe you've already heard of it, or maybe not. But it doesn't matter. What matters is that you can choose to yield before me, or to die. The gentle voice was heard again, but this time it was somewhat bitter.Who are you? How come I've never seen you in my vision? Not now or anytime in the future? The strands in the matrix were what Jinnar could see in his vision. However, even though Ilumia was standing in from of him, he could not envision her destiny. All he saw was a blazing beam of white light.We are on different levels. That's why you can't see me. Besides, you can't control your power well enough to even see your future. That's why you are trapped here. But don't worry, I'll teach you how to use this power, on condition that you make the right choice, of course.I'll yield! Jinnar answered in no time. Based on what he had seen, he was convinced that there was no point in defying Ilumia.A few days later, a holy fire blazed up to the sky and engulfed the dungeon. The village elder explained to the crowd that the inner demon had been suffocated in the flames. He walked towards the crowd, condoled with Jinnar's parents, and pretended not to realize the sense of relief on their faces.From that day onwards, the Holy Hall accommodated one more disciple, Jinnar, who practiced voiceless mantra. He was highly respected by the public. In order to show his determination, he asked Ilumia, the Goddess of Light, for a Voiceless Artifact, which he used as the core to forge a rare set of equipment, filling people with awe.The artifact was given to Jinnar on the pretense that it protected the untrained Jinnar and allowed him to communicate with others without speaking, as the parts of the artifact were able to emit the voice of Jinnar's soul through vibration. In fact, this artifact was the revised version of Sealing Formation, which ensured that Jinnar could not release his power before he fully mastered the destiny matrix. For the voiceless feature, it was just something Jinnar asked for and it had insignificant influence.Let none upset universal balance.",Jinnar_image.jpg
Kahlii,['mage'],"['Soul Summoning', 'Spiritual Blessing', 'Ethereal Pulse']","“The Tower of Souls exists for the salvation of the suffering spirits.”Kahlii, the Ghost Guardian, was a rather controversial Abyssal Lord. Once part of the Veda, she held the might and powers of blessing. Yet despite her untouchable position, she was humble and willing to dedicate all her time, patience and kindness to listen to the prayers of the believers in the Gospel Palace of the Sacred Mt. Orphean and do her best to soothe their wounded hearts and souls.Kahlii had seen too many shattered souls. It weighed heavily on her mind. “Master, how shall we relieve these tormented souls from their grief?” She often asked Edras, the Archmage of Veda and her favorite teacher. He was wise and powerful, and if anyone had the answer, it would be Edras.“When it comes to mortals, from birth to death, from happiness to grief, the Creator controls all. The mortals have to suffer to achieve innovation and change the world. This is the mission they’re born with, their destiny,” Edras would explain. This answer did not satisfy Kahlii. She couldn’t understand why these fragile Humans were given such a great yet heavy burden. All she could do was to try to help them with her limited powers.She was doubtful, she was lost. Volkath saw it all. The prisoner, kept by Edras in the Sacred Mt. Orphean, had yet to become the Dark Lord who ruled the Abyss, but was already as cunning as could be. He decided to bring Kahlii onto his side in order to escape from the clutches of Edras sooner and bring his rebellion into action more efficiently.“Time and space are both the origins of life. All beings in this world will cease to exist without the origins.”“Be it us, be it the mortals, no one would be able to escape the binds of the Order of the World. That’s where the origin comes from.”“But do remember—the powers that constitute the origin are not limited to just time and space.”“Light and darkness, too, are parts of the origin. These are powers that could bring us above the Order, so that we would no longer be bound.”“You know all about Light Magic. Naturally, you know that the essence of Light Magic is the control of the power of light.”“Wouldn’t you like to learn more about Dark Magic as well? If you have a good grasp of both, you’ll no longer be restricted by time and space. You’ll be able to do everything and anything.”“Such as...protecting those weak Humans.”What Volkath said was indeed appealing. Kahlii knew that there had to be a catch somewhere, yet the offer was impossible to refuse. She knew that the abyss lay right in front of her—yet she still jumped without an ounce of regret.“You’d better be telling the truth, or else, no matter what happens, I’ll find you and blast your head off!” Kahlii said. These were her last words as the Goddess of Blessings. Volkath was the only one who heard them.“As you wish, my Lady.” Volkath’s lips curved into an elegant smirk.From then on, the Veda lost a gentle, beautiful Goddess, while the Abyssal world gained a kind, peaceful Ghost Guardian. Legend had it that no matter how much you sinned, no matter what tortures you had been through, as long as you entered the Tower of Souls, you would be truly free.“I see the light.”",Kahlii_image.jpg
Kil'Groth,['warrior'],"['Sea Spear', 'Enraged Spear', 'Gore Lord']","The blood red sea roiled and boiled with fury.Kil'Groth was the ruler of the seas, where rage served as the only way to survive. Survival of the fittest was the normal natural order, but Kil'Groth's fanaticism stemmed from a complete disregard for balance in the food chain. The only thing he cared about was instilling the fury of killing in all sea creatures. As for what they killed, well, that was up to them.Relentless slaughter served as the source of power of Kil'Groth's rage. Fresh blood diffusing into the seas aroused swarms upon swarms of deep sea predators which then filled the gaps left in the food chain. Such intense rage power was intoxicating for the demons.Taara, commander of the Fallen, wielded her hammer like the coming of a cyclone. She used the power of absolute zero ice to freeze the ocean surface. The water, which was heated by fresh blood, cooled and even Kil'Groth felt the effects. His pride, however, did not allow him to flee a fight. His raging will blazed and freed Kil'Groth from his icy confines. He picked up his massive sea blade and began his last charge towards the intruder.Many hundreds died at Kil'Groth's hands, but, under the command of Taara, the flood of the Fallen drowned him like a massive tidal wave. When the bloody battle ended, the dying Kil'Groth lacked the strength to even hold his weapon. In fact, if Cresht hadn't led the beast army to the rescue, Kil'Groth may have died there and become a legend in his own right.However, Kil'Groth recovered from his wounds and ended up joining the Forest of Shadows array to show his gratitude as well as exact revenge. The furious Kil'Groth refused to follow orders from anyone. If any of the Fallen dared to insult him, his rage would finish them in an instant.",Kil'Groth_image.jpg

An assassin who is concealed in the shadows.It was difficult to say if Kriknak belonged to the living or the dead, because this being roamed freely amidst tombs, absorbing power by sucking out the essence of rotten souls, and yet it also had a body of flesh and its own soul. Of course, Kriknak was not concerned by matters such as life or death. The only thing it cared about was the orders from its master, Marja the Ash Weaver.As Marja's devoted servant, there was nothing Kriknak was unwilling to do for its master. Even when it meant facing Claves Sancti in the hands of Thane himself, Kriknak stood strong in front of its master and used its proud horns to block any blow that came forth. These horns ended up being ruthlessly cleaved away by Thane, but Kriknak's loyalty was rewarded through Marja's trust and gifts.Marja, in turn, reluctantly pulled off a horn to treat Kriknak's severely depleted energies, and transplanted them by infusing it with powerful spiritual energy. As the new horns took hold, the souls of Kriknak and Marja converged completely.Even if they were separated by a thousand miles, Kriknak would always know what its master was thinking, and would spare no effort to complete any task it was assigned to.",Kriknak_image.jpg

However, whenever danger draws near, Krixi's cruel side would emerge in full force. She would use her sharp fangs and claws to shred any demon who intrudes upon the forest.What really broke Krixi's heart was seeing the humans, whom she once considered her companions, destroying the forest for material wealth. Their armies were highly organized and armed to the teeth, so Krixi gathered the inhabitants of the forest in an effort to fight off the human invaders. The plan worked, and she was able to coerce the humans into signing a peace treaty.The forest quickly returned to its peaceful and serene state, but Krixi knew that the invaders' ambitions weren't much different from that of the demons.

She devoutly obeyed the words of the Great Ones and was thereby imbued with their almighty power. She was their herald, spreading  truth to the Great One's followers, in whose eyes, she was the embodiment of their Grace and Righteousness.The sincerity of Lauriel's belief gave her unrivaled power and, for a while, wielded control over reincarnation itself. During that time, the rebirth, resurrection, and guidance of souls through reincarnation were all under Lauriel's control. The flapping of her wings would bring new life into being, while the closing of her wings would throw life into yet another cycle of toil.While doing battle with the army of the Fallen, the followers once witnessed Lauriel spreading her wings and charging the enemy ranks.

Liliana,['mage'],"['Shining Light', 'Blinding Light', 'Unpredictable']","For thousands of years, Liliana had traveled to every corner of the world.One of the most ancient existences in Athanor, Liliana was born when the world was still in Chaos and all living beings survived purely through instinct. Full of curiosity, Liliana forged her own path of exploration in the chaotic world, continuing to seek for the essence of the universe and the source of power. She wanted to learn about the past and the future, the beginning of life and the meaning of death. In order to succeed in her quest for answers, Liliana morphed into different forms and saw life through the eyes of different species. A Nine-tailed Fox was the first sentient being Liliana came across. She considered the Fox her master and consultant, and was influenced so much by the creature that she identified herself as a Nine-tailed Fox thereafter. Through the instruction of her master and what she saw during her own travels, Liliana soon became quite knowledgeable. However, she understood that she still had a long way to go in terms of finding the ultimate answer to all things. She chose to live in seclusion, taking her time to slowly digest and ponder over all she had learned. Still, she would emerge from solitude every few hundred years to accumulate more wisdom and insight.During her previous journey, Liliana came in contact with Humans and was able to observe them up close. Humans seemed dull and average at best in all aspects, including powers, spirituality and constitution, which was why Liliana used to not have any interest in the species. Yet after she learned more about the thirst Humans had for knowledge and the ways they passed down their legacies, she soon became fascinated by their out-of-the-box thinking and began following their innovations and developments closely. Whenever Humans made huge leaps, Liliana transformed into one of them in order to learn from Human scholars.During the Dark Era, Humans were often attacked by Abyssal Beings. Not wanting to just sit back and watch the suffering, Liliana used subtle methods to reveal hints and tips on wielding magic here and there to aid Humans during the troubling period. From her observations, she predicted that if Humans survived this time of darkness, they would likely be able to create a civilization never seen before, in which new knowledge and new skills would be born, bringing her one more step closer to the ultimate answer she was seeking. She considered the aid she offered Humans a kind of investment—after all, if it helped her get what she wanted, why not? With a smile and high hopes for the future, Liliana went back into hiding.Some hundred years later, when Liliana returned to Human civilization once again, she was shocked to say the least. The candles and fireplaces she was used to were replaced by crystal lamps carved with magical arrays, capable of bringing light to thousands of families at once. The blades and swords she once knew were no longer used by many—instead, Humans Warriors now favored sleek and incredibly powerful mechanical guns and cannons. These improvements, which Humans called “technology”, completely changed how Liliana saw the world.It was an ideal turn of events for Liliana, who was eager to gobble up all new developments available. But even one with her level of wisdom would need dozens, even hundreds of years to digest all this—not to mention that new inventions were popping up practically every day! Therefore Liliana decided to transform into a Human and join the Empirical Army as a Communications Officer, who had the freedom to roam the Continent and collect intelligence. Her role would make it very convenient for her to achieve all she wanted. Of course, it did bring her new enemies as well, but Liliana didn’t mind doing Humans a favor by taking out these nuisances. “That’ll just count as part of my tuition!”",Liliana_image.jpg

As the time for selecting the chosen one neared, Lindis and Luna were deemed the two most promising candidates as they had displayed the greatest potential for developing their abilities and controlling the full power of the moon.But Lindis knew her chances were slim. Luna, her sister, outshone her in every way. She was talented, smart, beautiful, and held in high regard by their peers. Meanwhile, Lindis merely stood in her shadow, unnoticed and overlooked.Lindis bore her sister no ill will, however. She loved her sister and admired her beauty. And, in return, Luna lavished her normally quiet and reserved little sister with love. Their bond was incredibly strong, and as time passed, the two sisters developed a psychic connection with one another. Lindis was content just being Luna's little sister. She had no sense of jealousy as all she wanted was for Luna to become the tribe's priestess.Sadly, that heartfelt wish would soon be dashed. Mganga the Unspeakable had quietly maneuvered his way into the tribe. He began to work his charm on Lindis, plying her with sweet lies and luring her into his trap.Just as he was prepared to start siphoning away Lindis' power, Luna, sensing her sister's predicament, came to the rescue. Yet, she was not powerful enough to defeat Mganga alone. As Lindis returned to her senses, she was overcome with both guilt and despair. I'll take both your powers!

However, when the warlord came after Lu Bu, his mother fled. The warlord’s men gave chase and Lu Bu’s mother could not outrun them. Lu Bu’s mother sustained several mortal wounds on her flight, but her love for her son enabled her to somehow make her way to a river.A dragon heard the sobs of Lu Bu’s mother and appeared from the river. The woman begged the dragon to take her son and protect him. The dragon told her that he could only take one of his own kind. She begged and pleaded. Finally, the dragon assented. However, there was an issue; this would curse Lu Bu to share part of his blood with the race of dragons, and that was not something that should be entered into lightly. With her dying breaths, Lu Bu’s mother accepted the dragon’s terms.The dragon’s breath of fire vanquished the warlord’s men, and then he vanished with Lu Bu into the river below. Under the tutelage of the dragon that Lu Bu came to call father, the boy transformed into a man of some renown. The Dragon Father taught Lu Bu the ancient ways and arts of combat and tactics and gave him armor that was made from a dragon’s scales. Lu Bu loved the Dragon Father dearly, but his guardian had nefarious plans for Lu Bu.The Dragon Father preyed on Lu Bu’s hatred of the warlord that slaughtered his family, and used this anger to poison him against all humanity. He knew that Lu Bu could become the perfect bridge to his own rule over the world of man.When Lu Bu was finally released into the world, his first course of action was to hunt down the warlord. Lu Bu stole out from the riverlands and descended upon the warlord’s sleeping camp. His might was unparalleled and his ability to create and manipulate fire allowed him to slaughter every last one of the men in the warlord’s camp, saving the warlord for last.As he approached the warlord, the man he hated most of all, something quite unexpected happened. A young handmaiden stepped in front of Lu Bu. She carried with her the grace of the nightingales and seemed to have the ferocity of a lion. This was Diaochan, the maiden of whom one day poets would write about. Floored by her beauty and tenderness, Lu Bu’s heart was no longer his own: it belonged to Diaochan.Diaochan convinced Lu Bu to follow her away from this place of death, and he willingly followed her into an enchanted grove. Diaochan could sense the fire inside of Lu Bu, and spent several weeks quelling the fires of his rage. As Lu Bu relinquished his anger, Diaochan realized that her heart was no longer her own: it belonged to Lu Bu.The two lived in peace and happiness for a time, until the day the Dragon Father descended upon the grove. He was furious that Diaochan had taken his prize; her meddling had deterred his plans of domination. He reprimanded Lu Bu in front of his love, demanding that he abandon whatever dreams this harlot had filled his head with. The Dragon Father commanded Lu Bu to return with him to the fray to fulfill his destiny.For the first time in his life, Lu Bu denied his adopted father. He had seen rage, and he had seen love, and he chose love. This disturbed the Dragon Father greatly, and he lamented putting so much into such a wasted cause. Fire exploded from his nostrils as he pounced on Lu Bu, but the Dragon Father met his match in the form of the Dragon Born. The Dragon Father was able to gain the upper hand, briefly, but Diaochan rushed forward to place her hand upon Lu Bu, and a surge of power flooded his body. Together, they killed the great dragon, and in doing so earned their freedom.When the smoke cleared, Lu Bu and Diaochan were left to roam the highlands together. The legend of Lu Bu drew many to their cause, and he has become one of the greatest warlords in all Athanor. As long as Diaochan is by his side, he is invincible.",Lu Bu_image.jpg

Maloch,['warrior'],"['Cleave', 'Souleater', 'Shock']","Tremble, you bugs!Deep in the Abyss lies the Great River of Fire, a river of lava and blood that flows through the territory of Maloch, Lord of the Abyss. He is the greatest liege of the Abyss, and its most powerful warrior, heir to the supreme throne of Volkath, Lord of Darkness.While Volkath was a consummate leader by nature, Maloch's reign is crude and primitive, founded entirely upon his personal strength. Since the Ancient Era, the name Maloch has been a byword for strength and violence; he has led the vanguard of the legion in both the Divinity War and the First Invasion, terrorizing all of Athanor.A beast born for war. After many millenia, Volkath's assessment of Maloch still holds true. When the Lord of Darkness was slain by Tel'Annas,  it was Maloch who picked up his body and the Abyss legion's standard, rallying the routing demons and cutting a bloody escape for them through countless enemies.It was Maloch's ferocity in battle that allowed the Abyss Legion to move against the south, building several strongholds in the area. They may have lost the war, but they established a foothold in Athanor for the first time. And so the lords of the Abyss unanimously voted Maloch as their new leader.Barbaric brute that he is, Maloch was fiercely loyal to Volkath, and smart enough to know that he does not have the same talent for politics as his predecessor. Unlike the Lord of Darkness, Maloch shares his power with the other lords of Abyss such as Veera and Nakroth, as well as the Corrupted who join their ranks, uniting all of Abyss with a common interest.Of course, this was not Maloch's own idea. Maloch places absolute trust in Veera, and accepts her recommendations and strategies without question. The fact that they are lovers is no secret in Athanor, and Maloch prefers the blade that he can hold and feel in his hands to intangible and invisible political power.That is why Maloch has given Veera full control over Abyss territory in the overworld, while he has returned to the Great River of Fire with his demonic legion, training an army more formidable and terrifying than any that the world has ever seen. If the Temple and World Tree were destroyed and the Abyss were to achieve their goal of dominion over Athanor, it would not be Maloch sitting on its throne. There are so many other worlds left to conquer, after all.All that my banner touches shall be Abyss land!",Maloch_image.jpg
Marja,['mage'],"['Dark Pulse', 'Soul Devourer', 'Ghostwalk']","What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.The champion maiden of the Veda, the skilled of the skilled, the top apprentice of Edras, the Vedan Magician… Marja was all of these at once and the world loved her for it. Even Volkath, a captive of Edras, put aside his prejudice and hate for the Veda to pursue a romance with Marja.Brave and cunning, Volkath could do no wrong in Marja's eyes. Though everyone was mortified by this union, the two fell deeply in love. However, they were blessed by none and doomed to split, for their backgrounds clashed and their ideals were in complete contradiction. After a public fallout between Volkath and Edras, poor Marja was in a dilemma. Her master, should she stand by her master, who stood for all of her beliefs, or her lover? There was no way she could choose.The Veda expected all of its members to stand together against their common enemy, leaving everyone displeased to see Marja sitting on the fence. Though Edras understood and supported Marja's concerns, the others treated her as a traitor. Marja was a stubborn girl, however, and did not back down despite the controversy. Instead, it only made her more convinced that she was not in any way at fault.The war continued for a thousand years until Edras fell and Volkath retreated, injured. Marja was now hated by all in the Veda. She was no longer considered Edras' successor, and was instead fingered as the one who had worked with the enemy to bring about the great leader's demise.The Veda had evidence that Marja had lent a hand to Volkath, helping him gain powers that were not supposed to be his. Marja herself admitted that it was so. I did help Volkath, but that was before the war began, she explained. This doesn't mean that I'm against the Veda—I just supported his beliefs. Never did I give him any aid when he was fighting Master Edras—The enraged crowds did not let her finish her speech. The verdict was out immediately, and Marja would be punished by the hands of Ilumia, the new Seer. Your title, your powers, all will be taken from you. You will spend the pitiful remainder of your life slowly being devoured by bugs in your dark, cold cell. So, that's the price you must pay for love, huh? How sweet! I'm so jealous! Ilumia cackled, finally able to get her much-desired revenge, for she, centuries before, had also loved Volkath from afar, yet her love had always been unrequited.Marja did not deign to reply to Ilumia's snide remarks, considering it pointless to pick a fight now. Unable to get a rise out of her, Ilumia left with a disappointed shrug. The shadow worms in the Phantom Pit, however, were getting ready for the time of their lives. Marja, with her boundless angst, would taste so good! But Marja also looked a bit creepy. Dare they come close to her?Eat away, eat away! I won't be able to escape this prison unless you guys are well-fed, Marja said, comforting the terrified shadow worms.As the judgment was carried out in haste, no one really knew the details of how Marja helped Volkath with entering the Abyssal Fissure through the Phantom Pit and obtaining dark powers from the Lokheim. And Marja herself had also received precious dark powers from Volkath, one of the rare few gifts he had sent. Though no longer a goddess, though no longer powerful, Marja was still ready. It was only a matter of time. Soon, she would rise again.The day will come when I return and bring judgment to you all.",Marja_image.jpg
Max,['warrior'],"['Bionic Blender', 'Smooth Moves', 'Liftoff']","Technology will advance humanity!As stated by Max the Wunderkind in his autobiography, the genius inventor owed his accomplishments to his master, Moren the Technowiz. Old Moren may be contentious and rude, but he spared no expense when it came to Max's education.Max lived a rough life. His father died in war before he was born and his mother worked herself to death trying to raise her son alone. With no money to his name and no life skills to speak of, Max was left wandering the streets. He spent his time huddled near the home of humanity's largest producer of waste, Moren.Meanwhile, Moren was still mired in the shadows in Skud's wake. His productivity and quality was taking a hard hit as he tossed out priceless machinery like trash. This trash became a source of income for Max, and he, in turn, was inspired to become an inventor.Max's riches provoked the ire of the other vagrants. They banded together to chase the young orphan off their streets. Knowing he was outnumbered, Max wisely opted to retreat, at least until he built himself a mechanical weapon from the scrap parts he had collected, and returned to teach those bullies a lesson.Awakened by the noise, Moren was impressed by what he witnessed. The weapon Max held was rough around the edges but it held a certain sleekness to it. He invited Max into his home and questioned him about it. Upon discovering that Max had built it himself, Moren immediately offered to take the young genius under his wing. Max saw no reason to say no to the generous offer.Under Moren's tutelage, Max learned the intricacies of building machines. He built vehicles and even transformed the realm's feeblest soldiers into ruthless fighting machines equal to any other warrior in the field. With his inventions, Max became the youngest human in the realm to be knighted. Since then, he has driven his vehicles into countless wars and cemented his place in history.You'll be sorry you ever underestimated me.",Max_image.jpg
Mganga,['mage'],"['Toxic', 'Fortunate Gift', 'Detonation']","Power, is the only worthy pursuit.His ruthless nature and thirst for power make Mganga a natural in the world of black magic. In an effort to gain more knowledge, Mganga planned to enslave the strongest of beasts, and trade them with the demons in exchange for powerful black magic. The priests of his tribe caught wind of this wicked plan, and knew they had to intervene. With their powers combined, they finally put a stop to his evil plans.Mganga, always the one to hold a grudge, plotted mercilessly against the priests for their tampering. The priests, seen as the divine light of the tribe, were hung from trees or slaughtered in their own caves… Overnight, the tribe was placed in serious peril. However, it appeared that Mganga's madness had pushed the powers of righteousness too far, and they mounted a counterattack against him.They swarmed him relentlessly, leaving him no choice but to retreat to the deepest parts of the Dead Jungle. There, he took refuge amongst the venomous serpents and poisonous marshes. This by no means ended his study of black magic. On the contrary, he used his knowledge to communicate with dark forces, and now his mastery of black magic is greater than ever.The weak cowers before power, whereas the strong dominates it.",Mganga_image.jpg
Mina,['tank'],"['Whirling Scythe', 'Death Scythe', 'Dark Dominion']","Do you want to live or die?Mina opened her mouth to answer, but couldn't utter a word. The hunger from two days without food and the effects of drugs infused with dark magic were constantly eating away at what was left of her mind.Mganga looked down upon Mina with satisfaction. He could tell that she was nearing the breaking point. The experiment far exceeded his expectations. You must hold on just a little longer, my dear, Mganga said while putting away the equipment, one more day, and you shall be reborn. However, he failed to notice the growing cracks on the straps which had Mina bound.Your turn now. Do you want to live or die?Mganga was caught off guard by the voice behind him. It's not time yet… how did you… Mina's scythe was upon him before he could finish, but Veera, who had been watching in silence, finally made her move as her slender hand effortlessly pushed away the scythe. Mina's savage eyes softened before Veera's charm.Veera was happy with the results, and Mganga got the reward he deserved. As for Mina… her identity and unspeakable secrets were buried together with the remains of the lab, and the Mina that bows before Veera now is the Reaper Queen.Only the living fear death.",Mina_image.jpg
Moren,['marksman'],"['Tactical Maneuver', 'Impact Barrage', 'Magnetic Storm']","You call that a gun?!?Were it not for his violent and stubborn temper, perhaps Moren would have become a scholar, quietly studying in a tower somewhere. But being a dwarf, Moren was born to drink and fight, preferring fists and bullets over words even when the debate was academic. As a result, no scholars wanted to take him on as an apprentice. This forced him to use his dexterous hands to forge another path: science and blacksmithing.According to (somewhat incomplete) statistics, nearly half of the most highly regarded weapons in the land were either crafted or modified by Moren. Therefore, everyone, from the mightiest of Gods to the most despicable of demons, holds him in high regard. This also meant that Moren was able to maintain a neutral position and, in some ways, remain above it all, for a very long time. Slimz the Trustworthy sensed a new business opportunity in Moren's weapon forging abilities. After haggling over the price, the two eventually signed a lifetime contract. From then on, Slimz had complete ownership of all weapons created by Moren. In return, Moren received several precious mechanical diagrams, an endless supply of materials, and the Castle of Alchemy. This partnership made both parties extremely wealthy, but it also made them the new target of the Army of the Fallen.Following a joint assault by Preyta and Skud, the Castle of Alchemy suffered a devastating defeat. Slimz hoped to retain at least some influence, but he had nothing left to bargain with, and could not persuade the stubborn Moren to stop resisting. He had no choice but to terminate the contract and make Moren a free agent again. Deeply moved by this, Moren deployed his few remaining weapons at the castle and launched a final attack that halted the enemy's advance.Moren's actions enraged Skud who, in a devastating fit of rage, completely annihilated the castle's defenses and all but destroyed Omega, who had recently arrived to aid the castle's defense. Moren, who was seriously injured, attempted to detonate an incendiary bomb that would have taken Skud down with him. However, Omega dragged him to safety before he could detonate the bomb. Moren was grateful yet resentful. Eventually, he followed Omega's advice and accepted a proposal by Thane, the human commander. In exchange, Omega shared with him the secrets of advanced mechanical principles, allowing him to create a new generation of high-tech weaponry.",Moren_image.jpg
Murad,['assassin'],"['Thorn of Time', 'Another Dimension', 'Temporal Turbulence']","Space and time are the fabric in which this world exists. They are also a source of supreme power. However, none of the known systems of magic have spells capable of harnessing the power of space-time. Only an Andura Stone can contain the intangible power of space-time, and allow people to harness it.With the aim of acquiring this power, Murad's ancestors journeyed deep into the desert to look for fragments of Andura. However, Murad's ancestors were able to outsmart Azzen'Ka and acquire the fragments. They used the fragments to forge an extremely powerful weapon that could manipulate space and time, and built a new empire in the desert with its power.When Murad came of age, he inherited the weapon from his father and officially became the heir apparent. He led the imperial army on many expeditions, eliminating dangerous creatures and expanding the empire. This eventually threatened the authority of Azzen'Ka who was furious after discovering the truth behind Murad's weapon. But Murad paid Azzen'Ka no mind. As long as he had the weapon, Azzen'Ka couldn't hurt him.Azzen'Ka was forced to parley with Murad, and capitulate to the demands of the imperial prince. Murad gladly accepted his enemy's willingness to surrender, and missed the golden opportunity to rid the empire of a potential threat once and for all. No power lasts forever, and Azzen'Ka understood this only too well. From the shadows, he manufactured multiple crises that forced Murad to use his weapon to defend the fledgling empire.Overuse of the power accelerated the Andura Stones' decay and, unable to withstand the burden, the weapon developed numerous cracks through which the power of space-time leaked. This efflux greatly weakened Murad's ability to fight, and Azzen'Ka seized the opportunity to conjure a mighty sandstorm that completely engulfed the once prosperous empire. The weapon only had enough power to protect Murad himself, so after a plea by his father, he escaped the catastrophe.But he did not give up. He covered his handsome face and became a solitary desert ranger, seeking a way to repair his weapon while accumulating the strength to confront Azzen'Ka. Murad firmly believes that as long as he has his weapon, he will one day be able to kill Azzen'Ka and restore the honor and glory of his empire.",Murad_image.jpg

Prince or pauper, sinner or saint, all must face his judgment before continuing their journey to the underworld.When Preyta opened the channel between the underworld and the continent, Nakroth joined Hell's Legions in invading the mortal realm. However, unlike the ruthless Fallen, the souls under his command were prohibited from killing prisoners and civilians under his strict code. For Nakroth, combat was the means to test his mettle against the most formidable adversaries available, not an excuse for unbridled slaughter.Of course, Nakroth's benevolence did not extend to the battlefield, where he inspired deep reverence in his enemies for his bravery and skill. No one would dare ignore Nakroth's presence. The blade he wields is the source of our nightmares. Although usually reserved, Nakroth couldn't help but give a faint smile upon hearing such words from his enemies.In life or in death, you will not escape me.",Nakroth_image.jpg

Natalya, a descendant of these warriors, also carried the parasite.When one of the tribe fell to insanity caused by the overwhelming power, the warrior was devoured, and his strength was absorbed by the rest of the tribe. To fight the external threats, the Temple quarantined the tribe to breed stronger hosts.Natalya happened to be the best descendant the Temple had seen in years. To appease her, the Temple even sent an emissary with extravagant gifts to her coming-of-age ceremony. What they did not know was that Natalya had grown tired of the humiliating quarantine and did not want to see her tribe falling insane.I will bear all the sins! She devoured her entire tribe during the ceremony to end their cursed destiny. With her head held high, Natalya showed her determination to break away from the Temple, for she knew very well that the root of the curse was the ambitious Temple.Natalya faded into darkness and managed to split from the Poison Fang with curses from the same school of magic. In exchange, she swore allegiance to Veera. With Poison Fang by her side as a loyal pet, Natalya held the power to rain destruction in her wake.",Natalya_image.jpg

It was unclear whether or not Omega was created to wage wars or to end them.His existence and the contradictions his abilities possess had captivated and fascinated gods and mortals alike. Omega was one of a kind. It belonged to no specific realm or civilization, yet it possessed intelligence, self-awareness, controlled behavior, and a natural instinct to wage war. Theories suggested that Omega was part of an ancient, powerful, and mysterious civilization that proceeded all civilizations and divine realms of the present. Yet he was the only living proof of it, and was alienated by this world because of it.The intrigue of Omega's origins were not important, for the more pressing issue was its abilities and their contrasting connotations. Omega's compulsion to wage war and his prowess in battles had led suspicions to rise among the gods. They had every reason to doubt by which method Omega was created to end all wars.Violence for violence, war for war!",Omega_image.jpg

For Omen lived only to kill – not just his enemies, but fellow demons and the Lokheim fighting alongside him. All who could use him, feared him. Suffice to say, he was a loose cannon nobody wanted.The leader of the Lokheim, Maloch, was at a loss. He understood Omen was the physical manifestation of the Lokheim's desire to kill, and that retribution would be swift should he try to leash Omen's abilities. In the end, Maloch could only hide Omen away in the abyss. There he stayed, forgotten, until Arduin's army invaded Maloch's ranks.Maloch was badly injured and Veera was busy leading what was left of their army against Arduin's main forces. Neither had the energy to spare to defend themselves against Arduin's reinforcements. In desperation, Omen was awakened from his deep slumber, unleashing the murderous desires suppressed for many years. Omen stood alone on the passage of frost, fighting off every last member of Arduin's army.

He once tried to raid the supplies of an ally, and this lead to his clan being banished to the ice fields of the north. Strangely enough, this did nothing to harm Ormarr's reputation. On the contrary, his people stood firmly behind him as he fought for glory.Ormarr had never disappointed his clan. When the Demon Army engulfed the continent, Ormarr volunteered to lead the campaign to defend his clan's fortress.

Lauriel fell under siege of the Fallen and suffered severe injuries. She was left with no other choice but to escape into the Dark Forest. This is when she encountered the forest guardian, Peura, who lent her a helping hand.However, Peura had no way to resist the destructive power of Aleister's magic. In order to prevent Aleister from succeeding, Lauriel handed the Fountain of Light to Peura and stood her ground so that she may escape. Aleister was very cunning however. He didn't give them any chance as he dropped thunder on them and turned them black and blue.I will drink this all before I let him succeed! The weakened Peura used her last bit of energy to drink the Fountain of Light and the light energy it contained burst throughout her body. In fact, the overflow of power even burst forward and healed the prostrate Lauriel before her eyes.

Preyta's soul became infected, his mind warped and twisted until all that remained was a servant of the plague.

In his long mission, Raz won the trust of Preyta. Earning his favor, Raz was made head of a small strike team in Preyta's army. Using his authority and guile, Raz was always able to stay two steps ahead of the Fallen, leveraging sabotage and subterfuge to impede the dark army.However, Preyta was no fool. He could smell a rat.

Let your smile change the world.People often forget that Rourke, the perpetually bright and cheery Captain was once a dauntless warrior, until they see the scars on his arm. But what a warrior he was—this brave archer hailing from the Casanova Fort took part in hundreds of battles, including the infamous Battle of Bashkir. If you put all the war records containing his name in a stack, it would be taller than Rourke himself.The world was not kind to Rourke: every single one of his family members died one-by-one to war and famine, and his beloved brother-in-arms fell in the Battle of Bashkir, hand still clutching his longsword that had slain many an opponent as he drew his last breath.After that, Rourke lost his right arm protecting the Humans when a curse conjured from an enemy worked its way up his arm, forcing him to chop it off before it could kill him. But hey, we won, right? Rourke pointed out. The lookers-on sighed in relief. They were worried that their sunshine warrior would break down in grief, but it turned out he remained as optimistic as ever.In accord to the laws set by Astrid, the Duchess of Rose, Rourke was granted a sprawling manor after his return from war, meaning that he would live in luxury for the rest of his life without ever having to worry about working again. But that did not sit well with Rourke, who grew restless without a purpose in life.Thus, Rourke anonymously gifted the manor to the surviving relatives of one of his battle companions, and set off for the Federation of the Free, carrying a recommendation letter from the Duchess, and landed the job of Captain in a foreign town near the borders.To thank him for taking the position, the craftsmen of the Federation manufactured a mechanical crossbow to be fitted where Rourke's lost arm had once been, enabling him to fight like he had before. This is my new home. I've bid farewell to my past, and found my new life, Rourke stated. He loved his new place, as anyone who hears his hearty guffaws would be able to tell you.The townsmen adored the new Captain as well—he was not stuck-up like other officials, and was instead a constant source of happiness wherever he went. He was, however, a warrior tried and true when performing his duties. After all, you can't keep order in your territory just by being happy, can you?With the relationship between the Federation of the Free and the Verno Woods gradually improving and the promotion of the Chamber of Commerce, a market road was established, meandering right through Rourke's little town. The blooming business brought prosperity and crowds, and with them came trouble as well.You can fight all you like outside, but this is my town, my rules! As complications arose, Rourke decided to show the outsiders that he was no easy target. He had only one clear goal: to protect the town and the rights of its citizens, and ensure that all business affairs conducted in his town were legal and above-board.His efforts paid off. None who entered the town dared participate in criminal activities, for fear that the righteous Captain would smite them with one blow. Order was maintained in the town, and Rourke was respected by all.You wanna use violence to get rid of problems? I'll use violence to get rid of YOU!",Rourke_image.jpg
Roxie,['tank'],"['Wild Fire', 'Blazing Shield', ""Agnie's Grasp""]","Roxie and Agnie were a happy-go-lucky pair of adventure seekers.Roxie came from a long line of historically-renowned explorers—some of them were, in fact, the ones who dug up the mineral veins that brought riches and prosperity to Mildar. The happy (and definitely a bit insane) family would have been able to just settle down and enjoy a peaceful life of affluence, yet the desire for adventure that ran in their veins would not allow them to do so. Instead, they paid their most trusted friends a generous amount, enough to raise a newborn all the way to adulthood, and entrusted them their offspring so that they could continue seeking out grand new worlds without needing to lug around a whining child.That was how Roxie's grandfather grew up. It was how her father grew up. Roxie herself, too, was no different. The only childhood memories she had of her parents were letters that came every few months—as long as the intrepid couple hadn't managed to trap themselves in some mysterious crypt or gotten too immersed in exotic locations to remember to write to their only child.Roxie envied the lifestyle of her parents to no end. She remembered little about either of them, but their letters spoke of happiness and romance, and Roxie, being young and full of imagination, was completely sold. The day will come when I set off on an adventure of my own and meet my Prince Charming, she would always say. Her days were well-spent in detailed daydreams of her future travels, where she would journey to the end of the world and unearth exciting relics and mystic treasures alongside some dashing gentleman.Unfortunately, Roxie did not find her Prince Charming—life throws curveballs like that. Instead, she found her travel companion in a mischievous and infinitely annoying fire spirit named Agnie.A gift from Roxie's parents to celebrate her coming of age, Agnie was energetic and loved pranks of all kinds. With it came a treasure map Roxie's parents had lovingly drafted, marking countless explored and unexplored treasure locations. On the birthday card were the words: Go on, search for everything you could ever want. We look forward to meeting you somewhere along the way! Love, Mom and Dad.This was clearly her cue to set off on her first adventure! Roxie could hardly wait. She had her backpack and her mining pick. She was ready for Roxie's Grand Adventure.What about me? You should call it 'Agnie and Roxie's Grand Adventure', the fire spirit complained, poking its head out of the backpack.Who cares about you? I don't even need you.Bet you won't be able to even read the map without me, dummy!Roxie couldn't really argue with that. Agnie was right, for Roxie, despite her aspirations to become the greatest explorer to have ever been born, was hopeless with directions. She could barely tell which side of the map was up. That was the true reason her parents had gifted Agnie to her—she would probably spend days walking in circles otherwise.After bidding farewell to the kind, old man Moren, the optimistic Max and the well-meaning, little spitfire Wisp, Roxie was finally on her way. Agnie was a pain in the neck, but at least it was good company.But where, oh where is my Prince Charming?",Roxie_image.jpg

The other children had suffered the same fate as Ryoma: their fathers slain, it fell to them to pick up the mantle and earn glory for their families.Ryoma was timid when he was young. This, combined with his peculiar hobby of studying military tactics, made him an easy target for bullies. But Kondo always stood up for him. Kondo had studied under Ryoma's father and wanted to repay the kindness that his family had shown him. With Kondo as his guide, Ryoma became a samurai like his father.Their friendship did not last forever, as orders from the military sent them on diverging paths. The courageous Kondo was chosen to become the personal guard of the kingdom's heir apparent, while one of the younger princes chose Ryoma for his cunning. Once fiercely loyal friends, they were now rivals serving their princes. Ryoma would never have guessed that they would eventually become enemies.After some time, the aging king passed away while dealing with enemies outside of the kingdom. The princes, both well-trained in the ways of the court, quickly turned on one another. Ryoma, now the chief military strategist for the younger prince, swiftly led the prince's army to several decisive victories. The elder prince, running out of options, concocted a dangerous plan to send Kondo's death squad to assassinate the younger prince. The plan appeared to be successful as the squad reached the younger prince's throne without any resistance. Ryoma had anticipated this move from the elder prince, but was shocked to see Kondo and hesitated. Kondo and his squad took advantage of the momentary lapse and sliced through Ryoma's defenses effortlessly.By the time Ryoma regained his focus, he could hear his prince's screams as his father's words reverberated in his mind. There was no need to hold onto the past, and at that moment, he decided to give everything he had.Sword in hand, Ryoma sliced through every single soldier that dared come near the prince. It was Kondo's turn to be surprised, but he had no choice but to press on. Kondo's attacks became sharper and more deadly as he taunted Ryoma. The duel ended when both launched one final attack. Ryoma buried his sword into Kondo's chest, but Kondo's blade had stopped at the last second, inches from Ryoma's throat.Why? Ryoma was confused. I was always an orphan, said Kondo, I never had anyone other than you and my teacher. He'd be proud of y… Before Kondo could finish his sentence, Ryoma burst into tears.After burying Kondo, Ryoma snapped his blade in half and buried it with Kondo. He vowed to never again use his right hand, the hand that killed Kondo. He picked up Kondo's naginata and walked away.Glory and honor? The samurai code? That's none of my concern.

During the warring years, Skud was summoned to serve as Preyta's subordinate and lead the Fallen to charge forward.The battle for the Castle of Alchemy proved to be the pinnacle of Skud's achievements. Even though he had fewer than one hundred men, he successfully led them to break through the mechanical defenses that were laid by Moen, the arms specialist. Then he single-handedly destroyed ten alchemy puppets and fought his way into the castle interior. At that moment, Omega, who had been undercover for some time, issued an order to attack. Soon Skud and his men were flooded by a sea of steel.As he watched the Castle of Alchemy's defenses rose again and found himself surrounded by enemies, Skud became infuriated beyond reproach. The demonic blood in his body started boiling and his willpower was ignited. The iron blitz could not stall his progress. The strongest of armor crumpled like paper under his fists. The enraged Skud managed to single-handedly squash the enemy counterattack. Omega grabbed Moren and fled in panic, leaving Skud and his Fallen followers to enjoy the bounty of treasures and resources left by the army.When the battle finally ended, Skud got the reward he deserved: a set of alchemy gloves forged by Moen himself.

After war broke out, Slimz recognized a business opportunity and persuaded the arms specialist Moren to build a Castle of Alchemy in the border lands. This castle would serve as a continuous supply of weapons and equipment to warring men, beasts, or anything else that could pay the price. After all, Slimz was a trader and neutral in the matter.Business boomed for Slimz and he accumulated an astounding fortune, yet the scope of the war grew larger and larger. To protect his wealth and the flow of his business, Slimz had the foresight to build a private army that comprised of wild beasts, men and alchemy puppets. Unfortunately for Slimz, it was Preyta, the supreme commander of the Fallen, who was the first to go after his wealth. Slimz fought tooth and nail and even enlisted the support of Omega, the Awoken Mech for support, but he was unable to save the Castle of Alchemy from its ultimate fate. His wealth, which took him many years to accumulate, was lost in a single night.Hungry to regain his wealth and status, Slimz returned to the Forest of Shadows and entered a new agreement with Tel'Annas, the Queen of Spirits: The agreement stated that the queen would mobilize forces to retake the Castle of Alchemy, while Slimz remained in the Forest of Shadows and protected it in her absence.The debt you owe me will be repaid one day!",Slimz_image.jpg
Superman,['warrior'],"['Kryptonian Strength', 'Man of Steel', 'Speeding Bullet']","On the dying planet of Krypton, an infant named Kal-El was placed inside of a rocket and sent to the distant planet Earth. The last alien survivor, Kal-El was raised by farmers-Martha and Jonathan Kent-who named their son Clark and infused in him the strong moral values that would give birth to the hero known as Superman.As he grew from a boy to a teen, and then into a man, the radiation from Earth's yellow sun allowed him to manifest incredible abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, and invulnerability. He also possesses the power of flight, as well as X-ray, heat, microscopic, and telescopic vision. Yet, along with his tireless desire to help the people of Earth escape calamity and reach their highest potential, came a sense of isolation. Though he calls Earth his home, he is not of this world. The knowledge that his true home, the planet Krypton, is but stardust and solar debris, has kept Superman from venturing too far from Earth. That all changed on a fateful autumn day, when Superman encountered one of his greatest foes. The villain Brainiac, supercharged with power from an unknown source, descended upon Earth with a fleet of advanced robotic drones. It took every last ounce of Superman's power to defeat Brainiac. The Man of Steel's endurance won out, and before dispatching Brainiac, his X-ray vision spotted something with a bright, glowing aura. Superman removed the glittering gem from Brainiac's armor and felt a surge of power ripple through his hand and up his spine. Immediately distrustful of the object's incredible power, Superman retreated to the Fortress of Solitude to analyze the rare artifact. The Fortress of Solitude's computer could find no analog for the artifact's substance anywhere in the galaxy. However, there was one clue that the artifact found: a log from Kryptonian scientist Jor-El—Kal-El's father. Superman discovered that his father had been researching a similar artifact, which had been called an Andura Shard. This object, which could have given Brainiac the key to domination of the entire Earth, was only one piece of a much larger whole! The Andura Shard originated in a realm called Athanor, a place beyond even the Phantom Zone. Mainstream Kryptonian scientists had scoffed at Jor-El's assertion of the fact that parallel dimensions existed, and his boldest claim, that the magic which emanated from Athanor was linked to the physical universe, nearly brought him professional ruin. But Jor-El was right. As Superman eagerly combed through the Fortress of Solitude's archives, he learned that ancient Kryptonians had explored the galaxy in search of the Andura Shards, and may have even visited the Earth long ago as part of their quest. But as Superman searched the Fortress of Solitude, it was revealed that Brainiac had redoubled his search for the Andura Shards and, if he claimed this ultimate source of their power, all of Earth would be in danger.Superman has already lost one world: he refuses to lose another. So the Man of Steel has taken flight across the galaxy in search of Athanor and the Andura Shards. On his quest to fulfill the legacy of his father, he will find himself cast as the defender of a new realm in desperate need of truth and justice.",Superman_image.jpg
Taara,['tank'],"['Colossal Smash', 'Whirlwind', 'Steeled Focus']","The Iron Mountain Range laid at the northern tip of the land, surrounding the Holy Hall like an iron wall. This renowned mountain range was known for its deposits of metal ore, which served as the main source of income for the Holy Hall. As a group of people indigenous to the region, the Holy Hall directly governs over all of their faithful followers. The tribe led by Taara achieved many feats in the warring era. Though they lack the necessary crafting skills for fine weapons, they held their crudely-made hammers in valiance and smashed down on the invading Fallen at the foot of the mountains. Bloodbath after bloodbath, Taara's tribe paid dearly. However, even on the verge of losing the entire Iron Mountain Range, surrender never entered Taara's mind.On the day of the resurgence of light, Taara and her tribesmen held a great festival. They lit the furnace deep in the mountains and celebrated with pillars of raging flames. Thane's messengers came at this time, announcing the order of the new king; due to Taara's valiance in the war, she was conferred a noble title. This meant she now owned a wealthy piece of land in the new kingdom and her tribe was finally able to escape the life of material shortages and hard mining work.However, before Taara could plan her transition, Gildur's fury had spread to the Iron Mountains. As the Holy Hall's financial officer, Gildur knew that population meant production capacity, and he would not allow Thane to destabilize the cornerstones of the Order. Thane's messenger was exiled, and Taara was regarded as a traitor to the faith and imprisoned. In addition, the taxes for her tribe would be doubled for the next ten years as a punishment.Having the ground collapse beneath her, she fell from heaven straight into hell and endless torment. Veera, who had been spying from the dark, seized the chance to rescue Taara, leaving her with these words: False gods fail you in light; why not embrace true darkness? Disappointed by the Holy Hall, Taara submitted herself to the abyss. She was willing to be baptized by frost fire, and commit her soul to a dark will.I rely only on the power I can hold in my hands!",Taara_image.jpg
TeeMee,['support'],"['Pooty Poots', 'Chain Lance', 'Being a Bro']","Tee and Mee lived carefree lives before they became knights. No matter how close the war came to the land of the Afata, the clever Mee would always say, The sky will never fall on me! Meanwhile, all Tee cared about was eating his fill each day.Sadly, the good days were about to come to an end. It became harder to find food, what with all of the forest's resources being funneled into the war. The brothers had to get jobs cleaning up the battlefields in exchange for food and daily necessities. Even so, Mee never let any opportunity slip him by. Finders keepers! he would say.When the humans and the Veda joined the war, TeeMee began to find stranger items, the most valuable of which being the armor of a knight. It was just large enough to fit both brothers and was engraved with the Vedan symbol for resurrection. The masterpiece was built by Max the Wunderkind. Sweeping (and scavenging) the battlefield may not have compared to the fray of war, but it was still rife with danger. Still, they never in their wildest dreams expected this armor to save their lives.One day, in the midst of battle, the Lokheim army suddenly retreated. After the opposing army had cleared their troops from the battlefield, they sent in a crew to sweep up the battlefield, TeeMee among them. It was at this time that the Lokheim army returned. Forced into battle, Mee used all his wits to guide Tee and their allies on the battlefield, leading them to fight back from higher ground.And Tee, faced with the threat of death, grew focused and determined. He followed Mee's every command and even put himself between their allies and danger. With the armor's incredible defenses and the power from the engraving, TeeMee held off the Lokheim army until the army returned and proceeded to crush their enemies.After the battle, the brothers were showered with praise and gratitude, and it gave them a swell of pride. This feels pretty good, huh? Mee cautiously suggested. I love it! Tee replied emphatically. And so it came to pass that TeeMee fought in the front line. The brothers came away with their share of ridiculous and funny stories, but it was their determination and bravery that earned them respect.We'll make our own path to the stars! Mee exclaimed. To the stars! Tee echoed.",TeeMee_image.jpg
Tel'Annas,['marksman'],"['Eagle Eye', 'Penetrating Shot', 'Arrow of Chaos']","After bidding farewell to her verdant homeland where she had slumbered for a millennium, the newly awakened Elven Queen Tel'Annas shone like the morning star.As one of the valiant warriors who resisted the first invasion by the dark forces, the legend of Tel'Annas and her unrivaled archery skills became the subject of numerous songs and poems throughout the centuries. Renowned for her remarkable deeds in the decisive final battle against the invading horde, it was Tel'Annas who shot the lone arrow that mortally wounded the Lord of Darkness, securing the survival of all living things that had lost the protection of the Gods in this terrifying episode in history.However, Tel'Annas paid the ultimate price when her body and mind were corrupted by the dark power unleashed by the Lord of Darkness in his final moment. She was forced to seal herself and fall into a deep sleep that would last a thousand years, until all of the dark power within her was neutralized. For the entire duration of her slumber, Maloch, the successor of the Lord of Darkness, tried to break the seal and take the dark power inside Tel'Annas, but the seal was far stronger than he imagined.Seeing his opportunity during the second invasion by the dark forces, Maloch ordered a massacre of the Afata, forcing Tel'Annas to break the seal and return to the battlefield. Her striking face bore not a trace of the thousand years that had passed, and her mastery over her formidable power showed that she was fully capable of manipulating the explosive dark power that coursed through her. Confronting the army of demons, spirits and corrupted souls, Tel'Annas once again drew her bow to defend the life and dignity of all living things.The radiance of the morning star will forever protect this land.",Tel'Annas_image.jpg
Thane,['tank'],"['Valiant Charge', ""Avalon's Fury"", ""King's Glory""]","Thane's name is seemingly written on the first page of every book on human history. Not only did he break the dark reign, but he was also the pioneer of technology. In a time when faith was scarce and demons ran amok, humans used technology to break away from being ruled by demons and became their own masters.From a refugee that could barely protect himself to a king that everyone admires, Thane has undergone arduous training, has seen dead bodies covering battlefields, has slain countless demons and has lost countless friends. But Thane never gave up, and he always led his troops through dark times, clinging onto glimpses of hope when there was almost none.On the day of his ascension to the throne, he earned enormous respect from his people. Even though the Temple was wary of his rise, and dubious politics overshadowed the capital, people still believed that Thane would be the one to lead them to a bright and peaceful future.That's why Valhein, The Demon Hunter, brought his people from afar and swore fealty to Thane.That's why Astrid, The Indomitable, risked the honor of her family and cleared the way for Thane to become king.That's why Raz, The Fist, became a spy and formed the resistance in an enemy camp.Human fighters have decided to stop fighting against each other and unite under Thane, combining their strengths to create a tidal wave that will push history forward and drive the demons back to their abyss. When a savage beast learns self-control, even gods should be afraid.

The Flash,['mage'],"['Super Speed', 'Mach Punch', 'Cyclone']","Barry Allen was always moving a mile a minute—no one could ever get him to slow down. That changed the day his mother was murdered. Once a hyperactive kid who drove his teachers crazy, Barry’s energy was harnessed into a single-minded focus to find his mother’s true killer. His drive for justice led to a career as a forensic scientist, and he was completely absorbed by his work. When a freak lightning bolt hit his lab, Barry was imbued with the power of super-speed, becoming the Flash. Now, he races up buildings, across oceans, and around the world to stop those who transgress against justice. With his ability to run at near light-speeds, Barry has discovered the ultimate adrenaline rush. Through determination and concentration, the Flash has been able to learn how to phase through objects, create sonic booms with the snap of his fingers—and never lose a race. But the Flash’s abilities were put to the ultimate test by an unexpected event. As he attempted to save a group of children from a school fire, the Flash pushed his abilities to the limit, moving so fast that he approached the horizon of the speed of light. As part of his successful rescue of the children, the Flash tapped into the very heart of the Speed Force—the mysterious extra-dimensional energy that powered his abilities—and found himself swept into the Speed Force itself. Awash in the flowing, morphing, hyper-dimensional currents of the Speed Force, the Flash catapulted through several alternate realities, until he found himself in a magical land called Athanor. At first, the Flash lamented being marooned in this perilous realm, but soon discovered that where the Speed Force is concerned, there are no coincidences. In Athanor, the Flash discovered that the Speed Force was being syphoned into Athanor by one of the Lokheim generals—resulting in the catastrophe that kept him trapped in Athanor. The Flash has joined up with the rest of the Justice League members to uncover the mysteries of Athanor and restore the Speed Force. As he embarks on his quest, the Flash may uncover the true nature of his abilities—and this discovery will have ramifications not only for his own abilities, but for all the speedsters who have ever merged with the Speed Force.",The Flash_image.jpg
The Joker,['marksman'],"['The Killing Joke', 'Pick a Card, Any Card', 'Canned Laughter']","The Joker's origins are shrouded in mystery, but what is known is that he was once a small-time criminal who, after a freak accident, transformed into the Clown Prince of Crime. The Joker's belief that life can change at any moment drives his thirst for chaos, which has fueled his reign of terror in Gotham City. Believing that life is nothing more than a cosmic joke, the Joker has dedicated himself to showing others—the whole world, even—that in one moment, your whole life can get turned upside down. The Joker has kidnapped, crippled, maimed, murdered, and tortured countless individuals throughout the world, but his locus of operations is Gotham City. Or, it was. In Gotham, the Joker was obsessed with the punchline to his best joke: the destruction of Batman's ideals. Yet, try as he might, no matter how agonizing nor how elaborate the situation, Batman refused to give in to the Joker's games. Even after the Joker's actions cost Batman some of his dearest allies, the Dark Knight would not break. Instead, Batman turned the tables on the Joker by utilizing a highly modified version of Scarecrow's fear toxin. Prior to this moment, the Joker had never truly tasted fear. With Batman's altered fear toxin sluicing through his veins, the Joker was terrified for the first time. The traumatic nature of the experience was enough to unmoor the last fastenings of the Joker's sanity. Rather than stand trial for his crimes, he was committed to Arkham Asylum. Here, the Joker was a comedian without a joke. What could be truly funny in the face of true terror? The Joker began to despair that he might never laugh at the world ever again. That changed when a new inmate was brought into Arkham. This man, too, was mad, but in between his demented ravings he spouted lucid streams of mathematical equations and whispered incantations in hushed tones. And when he would sleep, a single phrase was on his lips: Athanor… Athanor. The man's madness intrigued the Joker. With some charm and deception Joker befriended the inmate and learned of where the man had come from. A scientist in a former life, the Arkham inmate had studied radiation spikes across the world that coincided with paranormal phenomena. The scientist had found the answer to these riddles: a portal to another world. The scientist spoke of this realm, Athanor, with reverent tones. It was clear that the experience had changed the scientist profoundly. The Joker was not in search of spiritual enlightenment or an experience that would cure his madness; no, he longed to see this world of beauty and order, so that he might make a grand joke of it. With his mind finally resolved to a productive endeavor, the Joker escaped Arkham, as he had so many times before. This time, instead of wreaking havoc upon Gotham, the newly freed Joker made for Athanor. After months of searching, the Joker finally found the portal to Athanor. And now, even the gods who contend to rule that realm will have to wrestle with the man who is chaos personified.",The Joker_image.jpg

Tulen,['mage'],"['Ion Blasts', 'Lightning Strike', 'Thunderbird']","Thunder! At my beck and call!Tulen was a demigod born to the call of thunder and lightning. He was an extraordinary child, able to bend thunder and lightning to his will. The thunder Tulen created was a thousand times stronger than regular magic. Some would call it godlike. Ilumia the Seer saw fit to place him under the tutelage of Aleister in order to learn the intricacies of his powers.Yet, the sly Aleister did not take a liking to Tulen. He sensed that Tulen would one day take his place, and thus decided he would teach Tulen nothing, not a single spell. Unfortunately, for Aleister, this method of teaching worked in Tulen's favor. His innate ability to control thunder allowed him to harness his powers without spells. While his vivid imagination propelled his powers to even greater heights.Tulen's success sent Aleister into a spiral that would eventually lead to his downfall. Tulen was not blind to his teacher's ploy, however. He had no intention of taking Aleister's place. Far from it. Yet, he also had no intention of giving anyone else the throne of thunder. He wanted the absolute freedom Aleister had... something a pupil like him would have great difficulty achieving.Finally, Tulen descended upon the temple with his godlike thunder and wiped away his teacher's sigil, burning his own upon the throne before stunned eyes. In so doing, he proved that he not only had the strength to take Aleister's place, but that the throne of thunder had already chosen him. Then, under Ilumia's guidance, Tulen successfully ascended the throne of thunder.His first task was to recapture the throne's previous owner – his own teacher, Aleister, for without Aleister, Tulen only held the title without the power. Tulen understood that this near-impossible task was given to him to curb his wanton display of power, but he didn't care.No one understands what I truly desire!",Tulen_image.jpg
Valhein,['marksman'],"['Bloody Hunt', 'Curse of Death', 'Bullet Storm']","At the eastern Gobi desert, the Demon Hunters, led by Valhein, had already been journeying in the enemy territory for weeks.The Allied Army, working in two routes in the north and south, had sent their main forces to the front in a desperate attempt to take out two major enemy contingents. The strategy proposed by Thane, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Army, was undoubtedly the one that would end the war the quickest, but it also meant that when Murad burst in, bringing news on the unrest in the eastern desert area, there was not a single troop to spare in the whole Alliance that could help him.In the end, the Federation of the Free, the Norman Kingdom and the Council had to each send some men to form a legion of “New Demon Hunters”, which would be in charge of the honorable task of taking out the newfound enemies. Instead of following the footsteps of their predecessors in the history books and clearing out troublesome invaders at the rear of the army, this flexible and speedy group was destined to step onto the battlefield themselves.“We have a huge disadvantage in numbers. However, we have kept a low profile while the enemies are out there being obvious targets, and we have more elite fighters on our side. We shall have the upper hand if we take the initiative to attack instead of defending,” Valhein, the Deputy Commander of the Demon Hunters, surmised after a quick analysis of the battlefield reports. According to him, though the Demon Hunters were a skilled bunch with excellent equipment, they were still not a regular tactical troop after all. If their plan was to head deep into the enemy territory with very few supplies, advanced equipment could in fact be cumbersome.The strategy proposed by Valhein was supported by all at the military meeting. Violet, his former Commander turned ranger, was supportive of his ideas as well.“So that clumsy, wide-eyed boy has grown into an outstanding Commander, eh?” Violet joked.Seeing that the elder was the only one left in the tent, Valhein finally relaxed, breathing a sigh of relief and rubbing his cheeks. It was his way to de-stress, and Violet, his long-time partner in crime, knew this only too well.“It’s difficult, huh? To keep such a great team running?” Violet said. She was serious now, voice soft and soothing, as if she was comforting Valhein while questioning herself at the same time.“I still have a long way to go before I can become as great as you and the old man.” Valhein chuckled. “Back when you were in charge, you coached us into the best army in the whole Federation and still had time to get manicures and pluck your eyebrows. Now, that was something, huh?”“Shut up. You know very well you’d never have the chance to replace me if I hadn’t resigned.” Violet laughed, teasing Valhein just a little bit.Ignoring her comment, Valhein continued. “Actually… I’m scared. Even though you all agreed with my plan, I’m still worried. The environment is hostile, and we have no backup. If anything happens, we could very well be wiped out. I’m not scared of death, you know that—I’ve had my will written ever since the day I joined the army. But I don’t want my team, my brothers, to lose their lives because of my decision… They all have families, you know? They’re not like us, we have no ties.”“Don’t give yourself too much pressure. You’re the Commander, your job is to win the war first and foremost. As for the risks and sacrifices along the way—you don’t have full control over those, and you never will. You need to learn to accept that.” Violet paused, then continued. “You’ve done great since the beginning. Even the old man or I wouldn’t have been able to do better.”“Thank you,” Valhein whispered. “For the kind words. And for returning to help us.”“Geez, you sap!” Violet slapped Valhein on the back of his head. “I’m here for the cash!”Valhein lifted his right hand and saluted. It somehow seemed like the right thing to do.He knew that Violet wasn’t actually here for the commission. Humans had souls, as did legions. No warrior of the Demon Hunters legion, retired or not, could ever forget the glory and responsibility that came with the title. That was where the soul of the legion lay.“We do not sleep. The lives of Demons we reap.”“We carry knives. We find those from the Abyss and take their lives.”“We trust our brothers. Together, we take out all others.”“We are not afraid to die. So hear our war cry!”Silently chanting the Demon Hunter pledge of olden times, Valhein let himself soak up the power and courage of the weak humans from a thousand years ago, when they first faced the terrors that were the Demons.“Where there is darkness, we fight!”",Valhein_image.jpg
Veera,['mage'],"['Hell Bat', 'Mesmerize', 'Inferno Bats']","I am Veera, Queen of the Night.Before she had turned to the Abyss, Veera was merely one of many demi-gods scattered throughout the realm, and not a particularly powerful one at that. The Creator may have blessed demi-gods with perfection in body and spirit, but not all of them actually achieve such perfection. Some, like Veera, were born with imperfections left from the time of creation, which neither spell nor potion could heal.Veera depended on her wits to survive. Before she went to bed each night, she analyzed everything that happened that day, seeking a better, more effective solution to everything, and teaching the solution to other sentient beings. Over time, Veera became known as the greatest sage of the land, the one to seek out to answer any question and solve any problem, and she leveraged her wisdom to earn a living.Among Veera's visitors, Maloch was the most unusual. Incredibly strong and quick to anger, deep inside his heart was as pure and simple as that of a child. Under Veera's guidance he learned to control and direct his destructive power, cleaving roads through mountains and turning rivers as needed. As they changed the world around them, their knowledge of each other also grew.The spark of civilization and love grew in the wilds of the ancient era.Yet with the declaration of the Decree of Light and Order, unbounded demi-gods like Veera were branded as heretics by the Temple. After a futile struggle, they were sent to Mt. Ophean, to be reeducated by Edras, the Archmage of Veda.Physically weak, Veera suffered greatly on the long journey. Her pleas to the Temple Guards fell on deaf ears and only earned even harsher treatment from them. If not for the care that Maloch, Volkath and the others bestowed upon her, she would not have survived the journey.And so hatred for the Temple grew inside Veera's heart, even as she eagerly absorbed every last drop of knowledge that the Temple taught her. To defeat an enemy, you must first know them. The wisdom that Veera learned in the wilds were equally valuable in the Temple.Veera's performance earned Edras' approval, and she was hailed as the finest example of reeducation. Edras even promised to do all that he could to heal Veera's defect. Yet none of this changed Veera's view of the Temple, especially once she learned that the Creator meant for the demi-gods to rule over the world. Why should we not exercise our authority by our own will? Why should we be bound to this travesty, this piece of paper?And so when Volkath organized his resistance aided by the power of the Abyss, Veera joined his camp without hesitation and brought over numerous allies to join the war. Her guile and wisdom were of great benefit to the rebels, dealing a heavy blow to the defenders of the Temple, giving the rebels valuable time to escape.Her unrivalled mind for strategy assured her a prestigious place in the Abyss. Whether under Volkath or Maloch, Veera was always their most trusted advisor. She built the Abyss Legion into a formidable force, further solidifying her position and power.It is said that Veera calls herself Queen of the Night because she inherited the power of Maniara, Primal Night. No one has been able to prove this assertion - or disprove it - and Veera herself has remained quiet over the topic. What is undeniable is that Veera has long bid farewell to her physically weak self, gaining a new body that is both healthy and seductive. To overcome a defect of creation requires great power.To most inhabitants of the Abyss, Maloch is their indomitable commander and the lord of the realm in name. Yet it is Veera who truly pulls the strings behind the scenes, much like Ilumia does within the Temple.It takes wisdom to combat wisdom.",Veera_image.jpg
Violet,['marksman'],"['Tactical Fire', 'Fire in the Hole', 'Concussive Rounds']","“I hate sand! I hate storms! I hate my life! There’s not even enough water for a freaking shower!”At the border of the Desert of Death, the Demon Hunters trudged on with harsh gusts of sand in their faces. Violet, wishing with all her might that she could just bundle herself up in heavy layers of fabric, cursed out this uncivilized, rough and barbaric land of sand. Her current status should have exempted her from such an expedition, but she came along anyway, due to the guilt she felt towards the members of the legion, whom she considered her own children.Only a few of them knew why Violet, the successor to Federation General Hartford and the second Commander in Chief of the Demon Hunters, ignored the potential for promotion and instead insisted on investigating the corruption incidents that shook the Federation, despite this not being part of her job.Though she managed to arrest a small number of sneaky maggots, several suspects in higher positions were somehow proven innocent. Quillen, a member of the Federation Congress, for example, was found not guilty of embezzling, and was in fact shown to have donated anonymously multiple times to civilians who suffered losses from new policies he proposed. Violet was soon discovered to have conducted unauthorized investigations and got in trouble not only legally but also ethically. To minimize damage, she resigned from her post immediately and offered to give up her retirement pension in order to keep the civilians quiet.After that, Violet became a ranger who survived on bounty missions posted by the Federation. She would sometimes leave the territory and journey to other nations as a free mercenary. She was quite satisfied with this lifestyle—endless freedom, no designated route, lots to discover, and always on the go. However, as soon as she heard about the upcoming expedition of the Demon Hunters, she offered to return to her former team without hesitation.“Some things must be done,” Violet had once said to Old General Hartford before she decided to investigate the corruption, and now she was saying it again to her Demon Hunter colleagues of olden times, while continuing to “do things”, holding true to her words.The expedition team had already been in enemy territory for several weeks. They followed the strategy devised by Valhein, the legion’s Deputy Commander, and wiped out several monster lairs, ensuring that the Inferi wouldn’t be able to utilize the monsters on the front line. Meanwhile, their ally Murad also used his influence as the former Prince of the Empire to rally rebels all over the land, launching raids on mines and cities belonging to Azzen'Ka in conjunction with the Demon Hunters’ operations.As the conflict continued to escalate, the lack of supplies began to trouble the allies. The Rebels, led by Murad, could only collect a limited amount of food and drinkable water from the survivors of the Empire. They had few medical supplies, making it impossible to go on. Even the Valhein had fallen from a heat stroke and barely made it through by sheer will.To ensure a swift end to the battle, Violet was nominated as the new Deputy Commander. After all, no one else was as qualified for the position as she was.If they toiled on, there was little chance they could complete their objective.If they retreated, they could at least regroup for another round in the future.But it was still a difficult decision for Violet.“Old man, what would you have chosen?” She asked the image of Hartford that she conjured up in her head. The honored man was, when all was said and done, the one who had seen the potential in her and promoted her to Commander of the Elite Squad from a mere Junior Officer in the Investigation Bureau. Though she refused to admit that she did anything wrong, she still couldn’t help feeling guilty towards this kind old soul who did so much for her.“I might not continue with the attack, but I sure as hell wouldn’t retreat,” the Hartford in her head said. Violet remembered what Valhein and the boys nicknamed him—the one-eyed devil. After losing an eye to the Demons, Hartford still pulled out his bewitched revolver and blasted the Demons’ heads to pieces. Naturally, he was not one to give up.“Everyone!” With her mind set, Violet announced the new plan. “Split into teams of ten, disguise yourselves and blend into tribes, mines and cities. Feel free to start a guerrilla war wherever you find convenient.”“Each team shall consist of one Captain and two Vice Captains that make combat decisions. If two out of the three agree, it is a go. The Captain will relay orders from the Commander.”“Rebels working under Prince Murad, please coordinate with and support our guerrilla wars as much as possible. The sick and the injured shall be moved to a combat-free area by the rebels.”“The objective of this operation is to destroy as many enemy military factories as you can and extend their preparation period for war for as long as possible.” Sweeping her gaze past the pairs and pairs of resolute eyes in front of her, Violet bit her lip. “Do whatever you can to sustain the operation and attack enemy targets.”“Remember—we are not alone. All in the Allied Army, all intelligent life who fight for order and glory—they are all our allies.” Violet raised her arm and clenched her fist. “We shall show them what the Demon Hunters are made of! We shall show them the true might of the strongest legion in the Federation!”“Forward, Demon Hunters!”",Violet_image.jpg

She believed him and carried on with her experiments, but at the expense of Max, who worked in the same lab and had to put up with mysterious explosions, shock waves and the mess that Wisp left behind...“Don’t worry, it’s just wear and tear,” Wisp would comfort Max with those very same words.In less than two years, Wisp had mastered everything about machines and what they are capable of. She also found her calling in bombs, which meant that she had to move into the mountainous areas with less residents to carry out advanced experiments.Naturally, Max was very happy about this arrangement, because it meant he would be free from the nightmare that is his sister. But being the big brother, he was still worried about her moving out, so he built her the “Destructor”, a mechanical transport that becomes deadly when loaded with ammunition.“Thank you, bro!” Wisp immediately climbed into the cockpit. Max suddenly recalled a fatal bug that he hadn’t fixed, but it was too late. The Destructor came to a halt after a series of grinding noises.Wisp scowled, “What was that? Did you build me something defective?”“It was just an accident!” Max replied, but he was really thinking, “well, you touched, it, so it broke down.”“Actually, you are now an extraordinary tinkerer, so you should fix it yourself,” Moren finally spoke up.“A piece of cake!” Wisp complied, slid down from the Destructor and grabbed the wrench from Max.Soon, Wisp and a functioning Destructor were on their way. Both Moren and Max had smiles on their faces as they saw her off. She was finally on her own. But before they even turned around to go home, an explosion rocked the area and they could hear Wisp screaming, “the energy core just exploded! Help me fix this!”",Wisp_image.jpg
Wonder Woman,['warrior'],"['Sword & Shield', 'Lasso of Truth', 'Bracelets of Submission']","Wonder Woman is Princess Diana of the immortal Amazons from Greek mythology. When army pilot Steve Trevor crashed on the warriors' secluded island paradise, Diana won the right to escort him home and make her people known to the world. Entering the cynical world of humanity for the first time, Diana found a people who needed a hero. Over the years, the ways of mankind have vexed Diana—war, hate, and a callous disregard for the health of the Earth—but her superhuman strength, speed, bulletproof bracelets, and the famed Lasso of Truth have aided her in the quest to bring order to humanity's chaotic ways. A warrior by birth and training, Wonder Woman fights evil while hoping to unlock the potential of a humanity she doesn't always understand—and it is this mission that has driven her to work in close concert with the Justice League. However, Wonder Woman's mission to promote peace on Earth is sometimes complicated by the political machinations and familial disagreements of her relatives—the gods and personas of Greek mythology. It was a message from her mother, Hippolyta, that eventually sent Wonder Woman to the realm of Athanor. Hippolyta had kept a secret from Diana her whole life—a secret that now threatened to tear Mount Olympus apart. Hippolyta confessed that she had a passionate affair with Zeus; the resulting child was none other than Diana. But Wonder Woman had no time to process the emotional uppercut she had just received, as she was attacked by Hera, Zeus' jealous wife. The ensuing battle involved many of the gods, but Wonder Woman was able to quell the fighting by binding Hera with her Lasso of Truth. Wonder Woman learned that Zeus had been missing from Olympus for some time—and in his absence, the gods were at war with each other, vying for control of Olympus. Zeus had left in search of the source of the gods' power: a star that was rumored to exist at the center of the universe. Knowing that without peace on Olympus, Earth and humanity would be threatened, Wonder Woman took it upon herself to find Zeus. But Hippolyta cautioned that what she would find in Athanor would make all of her previous challenges feel like child's play. There were gods in Athanor, with strange powers and magic that would rival anything that Wonder Woman had faced. But Athanor has never seen a hero like Wonder Woman. And when she eventually finds Zeus, what he tells her will have grave ramifications, not just for Olympus… but Earth as well.",Wonder Woman_image.jpg
Wukong,['assassin'],"['Shadow Clone', 'Great Sage', 'Monkey Business']","My magic staff is getting rusty!After completing the journey to the west, Wukong earned the title, Victorious Fighting Buddha for all his accomplishments, and he got to stay at Pūrva-videha to enjoy all the donations from the mortals. However, such a peaceful life was not suitable for the restless Wukong, who always thought about his days of adventuring on the Silk Road.Wukong had traveled thousands and thousands of miles by foot, and survived 81 tribulations. With the staff in hand, he defeated countless fierce monsters, increasing the body count along the way to the West. Wukong was never warm-hearted or well-behaved. Had he not been on Gautama Buddha's leash, he would have gotten into fights every day, even after becoming a god.When the crisis of Athanor spread to Pūrva-videha, Wukong knew that it was the chance he had been waiting for. Pretending to investigate the crisis, Wukong volunteered to head for Athanor, where he returned to his old self, alerting all heroes to his presence.As divinity tends to attract one another, Ilumia the Seer was the first to converse with Wukong. By her invitation, Wukong became one of the members of the Holy Hall and enjoyed the donations with the other deities. Ilumia promised that Wukong would not be bound by rules as long as he did no harm to Vedä. In other words, Wukong could battle any enemy hero at any time.I've been idle for 500 years. I can't wait any longer!",Wukong_image.jpg
Xeniel,['tank'],"['Divine Protection', 'Malleus', 'Angelic Splendor']","The dominion of the light cannot be stopped.Xeniel had a strong body and a resilient mind. As a pious disciple, Xeniel was absolutely loyal to the Holy Hall. His unwavering devotion drew the attention of Ilumia the Seer, who assisted him in becoming the head of the clergy.Everything is the will of the divine, and I'm honored to be at their command. Despite occupying such a powerful post, Xeniel was always humble and regarded orders as absolute. He wielded the Hammer of Penance, which served as a warning to all blasphemers; and he carried the Oracle of Enlightenment, spreading its words to the people. Within the Holy Hall, Xeniel's diligence and devoutness were unparalleled. For this, Ilumia awarded him the Six Wings, representing light and power.Xeniel's achievements were beyond Ilumia's expectations. During the dark invasions, Maloch and his legion of demons stormed the Holy Hall set on the mountaintop. Ilumia, in hopes of turning the tides of battle, appeared to boost the morale of her army in person. Lying in wait, Zephys and Nakroth took the opportunity to launch a surprise attack and ambush Ilumia, hoping to destroy her.Xeniel, spreading his six wings, descended from the sky and rescued Ilumia in the nick of time. His brawny physique withstood the attacks of Zephys and Nakroth. Although Xeniel was injured by numerous blades and projectiles, he stood tall and firm with his wings drenched in blood. The demon legion was taken aback by Xeniel's resilience and their attack halted, giving Airi the chance to ride out on her own and forge the legend of cutting off the demon's wings.After the battle, word of Xeniel's bravery spread across the continent and he became the Commander of Holy Hall, the same position as Yorn the Hotshot.Darkness has reached its end. Let the holy light shine on our land!",Xeniel_image.jpg
Yorn,['marksman'],"['Explosive Arrow', 'Heavenly Barrage', 'Heart Shot']","Darkness shatters in my presence!As the chief of the Holy Knights, Yorn had a strong body, handsome face, and brilliant archery skills. In battle, however brutal or gory it was, Yorn always took his stride in leading the Holy Knights to victory and glory. Because of his gracefulness, he was often mistaken as a fairy. In fact, Yorn was completely a human before being baptized. He was born in the Holy Hall and raised religiously. Yorn's biggest dream was praying piously for the Holy Hall and the Goddess until his death, yet, he was destined for more important responsibilities and duties.At that time, the first darkness invasion had been over hundreds of years ago. The human civilization of magic and technology had been thriving thanks to the territorial expansion. Meanwhile, as a result of the cooperation of the Holy Hall and the Kingdom of Okka, the cavalry spirit established by King Arthur, the first king of Okka, had been included in the doctrine of Illumina. The Holy Hall had also started to build up its own Holy Knights.Learning from the last war, Ilumia was finally aware that her demi-gods would be outnumbered by the ferocious Dark Army. Had the Forest of Shadows not struck back or Tel'Annas not shot that ultimate arrow, the world would have already been swallowed by darkness.Since the war ended hundreds of years ago, Ilumia had recruited and baptized a batch of faithful disciples from humans and orcs. The chosen ones effectively filled up the positions in the mid-management, so that she could execute her political plans more efficiently. The establishment of Holy Knights marked the fundamental upgrade in the Holy Hall's military power.The recruitment of Holy Knights took the teenagers by storm. Almost every teenager in the region practiced with each other every day on the arena to fight for the honor and glory of protecting the Holy Hall and the Goddess. Yorn was one of them, even though he was considered weak due to his ordinary human body, he still managed to pass the final round of the recruitment and secured his place in the army.What kept him brave and confident throughout the entire recruitment process was the prophecy from Jinnar when he once went to the church to pray. The prophecy went: Sky as bow, sun as arrows; divine arrow befalls, light outshines the sun and moon. The enigmatic prophecy perplexed Yorn, and Jinnar refused to explain it any further. To Yorn, his future was somehow related to bows and arrows. Since then, regardless of what stood in his way and no matter how his comrades ridiculed him, he put every effort in his archery training.Years later, Yorn had already become the chief of the Holy Knights. He was still grateful to the long period of training, which helped him through becoming a member of the Holy Knights, and also equipped him with broad strategic insights and unique fighting styles (killing enemies in one shot). For that, he was always in Jinnar's debt.On the contrary, Jinnar never admitted telling the fortune of Yorn. I was just promoted as a disciple at that time. My destiny power was very unstable, that's why the Goddess gave me an artifact to curb that power. So, I told you to do what you excel and avoid something you're not familiar with. That's what I meant and I didn't want to sound discouraging.Then, how did you know I'm a gifted archer? Yorn was determined to know the truth.Let me tell you a secret. I was obsessed with Tel'Annas, especially how she shot that ultimate arrow, so I was eager to make everyone learn archery!In disbelief, Yorn yelled, You were just trying to make a fool of me, weren't you?Does it matter now? Why so serious? said Jinnar, nonchalant.I heard something about you, Jinnar. You are afraid of the recoil of the destiny power, that's why you refused to admit having told me fortune. Am I right? Yorn scanned Jinnar, hoping to get the favorable answer.I told you again, and I tell you again-Don't be so serious about it. sighed Jinnar.I understand. Please accept my gratitude. I'll come back again.See you.",Yorn_image.jpg
Zanis,['warrior'],"['Blood Wyrm', 'Tail Sweep', ""Dragon's Wrath""]","Zanis' greatest achievement was undoubtedly his brave endeavor in saving the valuable life of the imperial successor.Since then, the people living on the slopes of Chang-Pan took pride in themselves for being in the birthplace of Zanis, the legendary Dragoon, who was respected by all. Even the undefeated Peerless Warlord, Lu Bu, paid his respects to Zanis. The swing of his spear is like that of a dragon: both furious and graceful. True fear is reflected in the eyes of his enemies when they face his spear in action. His prowess in battles and tactical brilliance could not be denied by any, not even his greatest enemies.I'm not a fighter, Zanis once whispered. Even the wise Zhuge Liang, nicknamed the Crouching Dragon, noticed Zanis was growing weary of the battles. Zhuge Liang could not let Zanis' potential go to waste, so he continued appointing Zanis tasks and missions, leaving him no time to second-guess himself. Regardless of Zanis' feelings towards combat, they never outweighed his loyalty to the emperor or the love for comrades. I may have grown weary of battle, but I'll always tend to my duties and fight whenever I am needed.",Zanis_image.jpg
Zephys,['warrior'],"['Death Rift', ""Death's Flurry"", 'Death From Above']","You cannot outrun Death. It cannot be tricked, bargained with, or intimidated. Run, and you'll only die trying.Some cultures told stories of angels or Valkyries that came to lead the dead to the afterlife; however, it was actually Lord Zephys who ferried souls to his domain with a chilling west wind. Steadfast and meticulous in his duty, Zephys personally harvested the soul of every mortal. In the final terrifying moment of their lives, it was his towering figure that came to rip their spirits from their bodies, so they would face judgment in the underworld. Admired by few and envied by none, Zephys carried the mantle of the harvester with unrivaled dignity, for only he understood the calamity that would ensue should he falter.In times of war, Zephys led his undead army at the front; his ranks ever growing as he reaped. Run, walk, or crawl, death comes for us all.",Zephys_image.jpg
Zill,['mage'],"['Wind Blade', 'Wind Shift', 'Tornado']","The roar of the storm signals your demise!History tells of many heroes who broke free of the constraints of gravity and flew through the air. However, none of them were ever able to attain the free, unfettered flight of a bird. The reason for this is Zill, a lethal danger hidden in the seemingly peaceful skies. The embodiment of the wind element, Zill can not only conjure devastating storms, but can also form the wind into razor-sharp blades that tear through even the toughest of enemy defenses.In the great war, Zill slaughtered dozens of marauding demons, earning him fame and admiration throughout the land. His remarkable martial exploits brought him status and influence. However, no one could understand why he refused the title of Guardian of the Forest of Shadows. He simply stated that the trappings of glory are incompatible with his free-spirited nature.When you need me, I will sever the heads of your enemies, tear them limb from limb, and drink their blood. But the free wind should never be shackled. That was the explanation he gave to Queen Tel'Annas. His unwavering loyalty and selflessness won the Queen's respect and trust. Before entering her slumber, she awarded Zill the right to exercise free will. Although this did not require him to undertake any specific duties, it allowed him complete access to the collective resources of the Forest of Shadows.Following this episode, Zill gradually faded from the public's attention. Other than the fairy Krixi who occasionally sensed his presence, no one else saw any trace of him. For a time, people completely forgot all about the hero who ruled the skies in the days of old. However, on the day of the Queen's awakening, Zill was the first to return to her side. For a thousand long years, Zill had given up the freedom he so desired to keep a silent vigil over the slumbering Tel'Annas. This was his way of repaying the unconditional trust she had placed in him.My blades will cut through any obstacle!",Zill_image.jpg
Zuka,['warrior'],"['Pain on a Stick', 'Panda Chariot', 'Skyfall']","A true warrior defends the weak and punishes the evil.Zuka was born in a beautiful and prosperous village. It was a hive of activity during the day, but quiet and tranquil during the night. It was a place where people were sheltered from the hardship and misery of the world. However, the one thing the inhabitants of this serene place valued above all else was martial arts. Despite being a young cub, Zuka had to study all manner of combat styles and ascend through the grades by passing the examinations set by his teacher. The young Zuka could not understand why he needed to do this. After all, why should he spend so much time and effort learning martial arts that he would never need to use? Surely it would be better to help work the fields or engage in scholarly pursuits? In response to Zuka's question, the teacher responded, It is not enough to simply wish for peace, one must have the ability to defend peace!Those words left a deep impression on him. When the fallen souls that emerged from the demon abyss spread plague and chaos across the land, the once peaceful village was mercilessly engulfed in the flames of war. In an effort to flee, the young Zuka embarked on a long journey with his family, crossing treacherous mountains as they made their way to the legendary Forest of Shadows.Zuka had heard about the Forest of Shadows in the stories told by the older villagers. Not only was it home to the legendary Elven Queen, Tel'Annas, but there were also countless elemental and orc warriors. They were the Queen's valiant army, charged with defending the land from evil.During the journey, Zuka witnessed all manner of depraved acts perpetrated by the fallen souls. The martial arts that he had practiced for so many years finally had a use. Wearing armor symbolizing his coming of age, and wielding a staff he made with his own two hands, he fought countless battles against evil and saved those who had suffered at their hands.Tales of Zuka's heroic exploits spread far and wide. From the noble and proud Temple of Light, to the Castle of Inception, which has long been suspicious of animal races, all factions publicly commended Zuka's heroism. Even Queen Tel'Annas herself prepared a lavish welcome ceremony in his honor. Then, at the invitation of Earth Elemental Lumburr, Zuka formally joined the resistance army, becoming a warrior with a duty to eradicate evil and protect peace.No matter where Zuka may be, he is an undisputed symbol of peace!",Zuka_image.jpg
