Zac ,Tank Fighter,"['Cell Division', 'Stretching Strikes', 'Unstable Matter', 'Elastic Slingshot', ""Let's Bounce!""]","The Foreglow affects everyone differently. For Zac, it burned away all of his insecurities, but opened up his senses to the loneliness felt by the other Zacs across the realms. They needed him, and now he has the power to bring everyone together as one. A family reunion for the ages.",zac_image.png
Zed ,Assassin,"['Contempt for the Weak', 'Razor Shuriken', 'Living Shadow', 'Shadow Slash', 'Death Mark']","The Foreglow is a power many desire, but Zed resents how it exposes him.

Seeing a way out, Zyra merged with the 4th-dimensional horrors from Beyond. She now follows the edicts of an alien power, ripping veins of sentient sludge from the earth and rending her enemies asunder.",zyra_image.png
