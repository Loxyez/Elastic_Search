That's just Neeko, pulling one of her classic pranks."
Nidalee ,Assassin Mage,"['Prowl', 'Javelin Toss', 'Bushwhack', 'Primal Surge', 'Takedown', 'Pounce', 'Swipe', 'Aspect of the Cougar']","The Ocean Song Festival is lucky to have Nidalee as its performer stylist, with her fashion guides selling almost as much as her albums, but in reality she's here as a featured part of Yone's show. She was the first person he showed his lyrics to, and it's her honor to lend them her voice."
Nilah ,Fighter Assassin,"['Joy Unending', 'Formless Blade', 'Jubilant Veil', 'Slipstream', 'Apotheosis']","A powerful Outer Guardian who patrols the wider universe, Nilah has faced multiple reality-ending threats and returned alive... making her a living legend among her peers.

Nocturne ,Assassin Fighter,"['Umbra Blades', 'Duskbringer', 'Shroud of Darkness', 'Unspeakable Horror', 'Paranoia']","Not every part of the Hextech renaissance led to bright innovations. A clandestine experiment to fuse Hextech with demonic energies wrought a living nightmare, a predator rumored to stalk the streets and back alleyways of the city. Authorities report that any such creation would have been terminated along with any such project, and that any missing persons reports are, of course, completely unrelated."
Nunu & Willump ,Tank Fighter,"['Call of the Freljord', 'Consume', 'Biggest Snowball Ever!', 'Snowball Barrage', 'Absolute Zero']",They're like two bees in a pod. Err… in a hive?

Pantheon ,Fighter Assassin,"['Mortal Will', 'Comet Spear', 'Shield Vault', 'Aegis Assault', 'Grand Starfall']","A brave knight of old, who legends say slew a god in battle so that all humankind might see that they were their own masters.

Renata Glasc ,Support Mage,"['Leverage', 'Handshake', 'Bailout', 'Loyalty Program', 'Hostile Takeover']","Tender loving care and spoons of sugar spiceAnd all the other things that make a mommy niceIt choked her throat and lungs and showed her virtue's viceSome chosen children love the dark, that's Mother Glasc's advice!"
Renekton ,Fighter Tank,"['Reign of Anger', 'Cull the Meek', 'Ruthless Predator', 'Slice', 'Dice', 'Dominus']","A hybridized warrior taking inspiration from extinct fauna, Renekton is the perfected version of PROJECT's crossbreed superweapon project.

Samira ,Marksman,"['Daredevil Impulse', 'Flair', 'Blade Whirl', 'Wild Rush', 'Inferno Trigger', '/taunt']","The poster was straightforward enough: “WANTED: Tahm Kench - Devil, DEAD OR ALIVE”, followed by a generous sum.

Shaco ,Assassin,"['Backstab', 'Deceive', 'Jack in the Box', 'Two-Shiv Poison', 'Hallucinate']","Once a mere courier for the Twitch syndicate, Shaco is now barely human. The eldritch corruption has stripped him of reason and identity, turning him into a chittering horde of knife-wielding monsters that haunt the boroughs of Valoran City. None of them are sure which is the “real” Shaco anymore. None of them care."
Shen ,Tank,"['Ki Barrier', 'Twilight Assault', ""Spirit's Refuge"", 'Shadow Dash', 'Stand United']","Once half of an elite operative duo for the Shockblade order, Shen stepped away from combat after he made a mistake that nearly cost the life of his partner, Zed.

Sona ,Support Mage,"['Power Chord', 'Hymn of Valor', 'Aria of Perseverance', 'Song of Celerity', 'Crescendo']","Quiet and reflective, Sona spends her time away from the Guardians as a composer of music... and her time with them as a fighter of incredible power, blasting enemies away with sonically charged starlight.

Sylas ,Mage Assassin,"['Petricite Burst', 'Chain Lash', 'Kingslayer', 'Abscond', 'Abduct', 'Hijack']","Sylas deeply loved magic, but long years of imprisonment made him hateful. As a knight, he deigned to take as much power for himself as he could, and perhaps become a new wellspring of enchantment… yet, it was all for naught.

Syndra ,Mage,"['Transcendent', 'Dark Sphere', 'Force of Will', 'Scatter the Weak', 'Unleashed Power']","Children hear stories of the savior of lost souls, the ever-reclusive Spirit of Freedom. One such speaks of a tree that wrapped its roots around a wandering wisp.

Talon ,Assassin,"[""Blade's End"", 'Noxian Diplomacy', 'Rake', ""Assassin's Path"", 'Shadow Assault']","Devilishly handsome and wearing the latest in Western chic, Talon is equally ready to rock the runway or ride the open road.

Tristana ,Marksman Assassin,"['Draw a Bead', 'Rapid Fire', 'Rocket Jump', 'Explosive Charge', 'Buster Shot']","For those that seek glory on the battlefield, to those that look to the spirits for a bountiful harvest, Tristana greets all with a toothy grin.

But even he can't find a trace of his long lost partner, Graves. So when some cats offered him intel on Grave's whereabouts in exchange for the location of the legendary underground disco, The Jam, he happily obliged. What's a few party crashers, anyway?"
Twitch ,Marksman Assassin,"['Deadly Venom', 'Ambush', 'Venom Cask', 'Contaminate', 'Spray and Pray']","It starts like this: An ill wind blows across the desert, dessicated rats turn up in the streets, rotting under the hot sun.

Varus ,Marksman Mage,"['Living Vengeance', 'Piercing Arrow', 'Blighted Quiver', 'Hail of Arrows', 'Chain of Corruption']","Ain't nothin' for a dead angel to do but resign himself to grief. Varus was content to allow Mordekaiser to take him past the infernal gates themselves… Until a ragtag gang of thieves interrupted his mourning.

Vel'Koz ,Mage,"['Organic Deconstruction', 'Plasma Fission', 'Void Rift', 'Tectonic Disruption', 'Life Form Disintegration Ray']","Beneath the ice they slumber, trapped as two worlds pass them by. Watching, waiting, for the day they will rise again, and all will be buried in ice."
Vex ,Mage,"[""Doom 'n Gloom"", 'Mistral Bolt', 'Personal Space', 'Looming Darkness', 'Shadow Surge']","Vex didn't need anyone. Growing up alone, she was self-sufficient and annoyed by most people.

Viktor ,Mage,"['Glorious Evolution', 'Siphon Power', 'Gravity Field', 'Death Ray', 'Chaos Storm']","Many a road to Hell was paved with good intent. Dr. Viktor may be the Mechanical Devil's kept engineer now, but his work began as charity: trying to “rehome” the souls of the dead in clockwork bodies, in order to circumvent mortality itself.

Father Wolf howls into the night once more, now slavering for the taste of human flesh."
Wukong ,Fighter Tank,"['Stone Skin', 'Crushing Blow', 'Warrior Trickster', 'Nimbus Strike', 'Cyclone']","A consummate troublemaker and prankster, Wukong has failed out of every high school in the region, eventually washing out into Labrys as an 'enrollment of last resort'.

Xerath ,Mage,"['Mana Surge', 'Arcanopulse', 'Eye of Destruction', 'Shocking Orb', 'Rite of the Arcane']","Ensnared by his own desires, Xerath leads citizens of Low Arcana to act on their basest urges. The more they are entranced by the forbidden, the more his power grows.

Xin Zhao ,Fighter Assassin,"['Determination', 'Three Talon Strike', 'Wind Becomes Lightning', 'Audacious Charge', 'Crescent Guard']","Xin Zhao is a popular man at the New Year's festival— and not just because he hands out lots of red envelopes.

Yasuo ,Fighter Assassin,"['Way of the Wanderer', 'Steel Tempest', 'Wind Wall', 'Sweeping Blade', 'Last Breath']","The song of steel grew silent, and Yasuo was the last living soul on the battlefield—though he imagined he could hear the thankful murmurs of the villagers he'd protected. Wounded and dying, Yasuo produced his flute to play a last haunting elegy. The Dragon of Dreams descended from its mountaintop, moved by Yasuo's song, and offered him its power..."
Yone ,Assassin Fighter,"['Way of the Hunter', 'Mortal Steel', 'Spirit Cleave', 'Soul Unbound', 'Fate Sealed']","Yone is nervous. As a DJ he's calm, focused, and improvisational, but Ocean Song is his first concert as a DJ and lyricist.

Zed ,Assassin,"['Contempt for the Weak', 'Razor Shuriken', 'Living Shadow', 'Shadow Slash', 'Death Mark']","The Foreglow is a power many desire, but Zed resents how it exposes him.

Zeri ,Marksman,"['Basic Attack', 'Living Battery', 'Burst Fire', 'Ultrashock Laser', 'Spark Surge', 'Lightning Crash']","An up and coming Water Tamer from the Southwest, Zeri is diving into the Ocean Song Festival headfirst. This is her first time handling a stage on her own, and she may have gone a little overboard with her showstopper plans in order to give herself a calling card.
